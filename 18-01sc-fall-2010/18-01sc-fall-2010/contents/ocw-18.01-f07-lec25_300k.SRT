9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
PROFESSOR: Now, today I need
to get started by finishing

10
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
up what I did last time.
 

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
Namely, talking about
numerical methods.

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
And I want to just
carry out one example.

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
And then I want to fill
in one loose end.

14
00:00:40 --> 00:00:48
And then we'll talk
about the unit overall.

15
00:00:48 --> 00:01:01
We were talking, last time,
about numerical integration.

16
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
I'm going to illustrate this
just with the simplest

17
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
example that I can.
 

18
00:01:07 --> 00:01:14
We're going to look at the
integral from 1 to 2 of dx / x.

19
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Which we know perfectly well
already is the log of x

20
00:01:18 --> 00:01:23
evaluated between 1 and
2, which is ln 2 - ln 1.

21
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Which is just ln 2.
 

22
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
Now, if you punch that into
your calculator, you're going

23
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
to get something like this.
 

24
00:01:32 --> 00:01:41
I hope I saved it here.
 

25
00:01:41 --> 00:01:41
Yeah.
 

26
00:01:41 --> 00:01:53
It's about 0.693147.
 

27
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
That's more digits than
we're going to get in

28
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
our discussion here.
 

29
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
Anyway, that's about how
big this number is.

30
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
And the numerical integration
methods will give you about

31
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
as much accuracy as you can
get on the function itself.

32
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
And, of course, some
functions we may have more

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
trouble approximating.
 

34
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
But the function 1 / x, we know
pretty well how to do, because

35
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
we know how to divide.
 

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
So since the function that
we're integrating here is 1 /

37
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
x, it's going to be not too
difficult to get

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
some arithmetic.
 

39
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
Nevertheless, I'm going to
do this in the simplest

40
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
possible case.
 

41
00:02:34 --> 00:02:44
Namely, just with
two intervals.

42
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Now, you really can't expect
things to work so well

43
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
with two intervals.
 

44
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
That's a pretty ridiculous
approximation to your function.

45
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
When you have two intervals,
that means you're looking at

46
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
the graph of this hyperbola.
 

47
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
And you have 1 here, and you
have 2 here and you have 3/2.

48
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
And you're really only
keeping track of the values

49
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
at these three spots.
 

50
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
So the idea that you can
approximate the area just by

51
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
knowing the values of three
places is a little bit of a

52
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
stretch of the imagination.
 

53
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
But we're going to
try it anyway.

54
00:03:24 --> 00:03:33
Now, the trapezoidal rule
is the following formula.

55
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
It's delta x ( 1/2 the first
value + the second value

56
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
+ 1/2 the third value).
 

57
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
In this case, the pattern is
1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1/2.

58
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
And in this case, delta
x = 1/2 because this

59
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
interval's of length 1.
 

60
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
The b - a, right.
 

61
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
Let's just point that out here.
 

62
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
Here, b = 2. a = 1. b - a = 1.
 

63
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
And the number n = 2.
 

64
00:04:08 --> 00:04:16
And so, delta x, which
is b - a / n = 1/2.

65
00:04:16 --> 00:04:17
So here's what we get.
 

66
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
And let's just see
what this number is.

67
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
It's 1/2 of the value at here.
 

68
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Well, so let's just check
what these values are.

69
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
This value is 1, this value
over here is 2/3, and

70
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
the last value is 1/2.
 

71
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
Because the function, of
course, was y = 1 / x.

72
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
And those were the three
values that we have.

73
00:04:38 --> 00:04:47
So y0, this one is y0, this one
is y1, and this one is y2.

74
00:04:47 --> 00:05:00
Now, here we have (1/2*
1 + 2/3 + 1/2 * 1/2).

75
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
Now, on an exam, I don't expect
you to add up long messes

76
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
of numbers like this.
 

77
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
When you have two numbers, I
expect you to add them up if

78
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
they're reasonable,
or subtract them.

79
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Just as we do when we
take antiderivatives.

80
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
Like, for example, I don't want
you to leave the answer to

81
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
an integration like
this in this form.

82
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
I want you to simplify it
at least down to here.

83
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
And I of course don't
expect you to know the

84
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
numerical approximation.
 

85
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
But I certainly expect you
to be able to do that.

86
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
On the other hand, when the
arithmetic gets a little bit

87
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
long, you can relax
a little bit.

88
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
But I did carry this
out on my calculator.

89
00:05:35 --> 00:05:41
Unless I'm mistaken,
it's about 0.96.

90
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
It's pretty far off.
 

91
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
So remember what it was.
 

92
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
It's what you get when you
get these straight lines.

93
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
And there are these little
extra pieces of junk there.

94
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
Now, don't trust that
too much, but the point

95
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
is that it's far off.
 

96
00:06:00 --> 00:06:09
So now, let's take a
look at Simpson's Rule.

97
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
And I claim that Simpson's Rule
is surprisingly accurate.

98
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
In this case, really,
even a little more than

99
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
it deserves to be.
 

100
00:06:17 --> 00:06:29
The formula is (delta x
/ 3) ( y0 + 4 y1 + y2).

101
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
So the pattern is 1, 4, 1, or
1, 4 and then it alternates

102
00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
2's and 4's until 4,
1 at the very end.

103
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
And if I just plug in the
numbers now, what I get is 1/6,

104
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
because delta x = 1/2 again.
 

105
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
And the value for y0 = 1.
 

106
00:06:50 --> 00:06:55
And the value for y1 = 2/3.
 

107
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
And the value for y2 = 1/2.
 

108
00:06:59 --> 00:07:03
So here's the estimate
in this case.

109
00:07:03 --> 00:07:08
And this one I did
carry out carefully.

110
00:07:08 --> 00:07:16
And it came out to 0.69444.
 

111
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
Which is actually pretty
impressive, if you

112
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
think about it.
 

113
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
Given what the logarithm is.
 

114
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
Now, what's going on
with Simpson's Rule

115
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
in general is this.
 

116
00:07:33 --> 00:07:43
If you -- Simpson's
minus the exact answer.

117
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
In absolute value, is
approximately of the

118
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
size of (delta x)^ 4.
 

119
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
That's really the
way it behaves.

120
00:07:52 --> 00:08:03
Which means that if delta x is
about 1/10, so if we had

121
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
divided this up into 10,
intervals which we didn't, but

122
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
if we'd divided it up into 10
intervals, then you could

123
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
expect that delta x, the error
would be about 10 ^ - 4.

124
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
In other words, four digits of
accuracy here for this thing.

125
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
But the exact analysis of this,
a more careful analysis of

126
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
this, is in your textbook.
 

127
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
And I'm not going to do.
 

128
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
But I just want to point out
that it is an effective method.

129
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
It really does give you nice
four-digit with manageable,

130
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
you could even really
do it by hand.

131
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
It's so convenient.
 

132
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
The Simpson's Rule.
 

133
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
Whereas the other rules aren't
really that impressive as

134
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
far as giving fairly
accurate answers.

135
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
The last little remark to
make is that the reason

136
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
is that Simpson's Rule
is matching a parabola.

137
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
And somehow the parabola
follows this curve better.

138
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
It's giving the exact answer.
 

139
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
So I'll mention this.
 

140
00:09:07 --> 00:09:27
Simpson's Rule is derived using
the exact answer for all

141
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
degree 2 polynomials.
 

142
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
In other words, parabolas.
 

143
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
All parabolas.
 

144
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
But even all the ones
of lower degree.

145
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
So straight lines would
work, and constants

146
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
would work as well.
 

147
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
Whereas the other ones only
work for, say, straight lines.

148
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
The trapezoidal rule only
works for straight lines.

149
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
But ther isn't a
weird accident.

150
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
It turns out that it
also works for cubics.

151
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
Once you get the formulas,
it works for cubics.

152
00:09:59 --> 00:10:06
So it's also exact for cubics.
 

153
00:10:06 --> 00:10:12
And that's what explains
the fourth order validity.

154
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
The last thing that I want
to point out is that this

155
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
is extremely vague,
that I said there.

156
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
And you should be a little
bit cautious about it.

157
00:10:20 --> 00:10:30
You need to watch out
for 1 / x for x near 0.

158
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
All bets are off if the
function is singular.

159
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
And there's a lot of
area under there.

160
00:10:36 --> 00:10:40
And it's also true that if
the derivative messes up,

161
00:10:40 --> 00:10:41
you're in trouble too.
 

162
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
You really need for the
function to be nice and smooth

163
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
in order for Simpson's
Rule to work.

164
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
This is woth out.
 

165
00:10:48 --> 00:10:54
That's a real woth
out, but try to.

166
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
Watch out.
 

167
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
Watch out for
whenever x near 0.

168
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Then this thing doesn't work.
 

169
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
This thing really depends
on bounds on derivatives.

170
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
But I'm going to be
relatively vague about that.

171
00:11:05 --> 00:11:12
I'm not attempting to give
you an error analysis here.

172
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
OK, so if you were doing
this on an exam, how do

173
00:11:16 --> 00:11:21
you remember this strange
pattern of numbers?

174
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
The one thing that I want to
recommend to you is, as a way

175
00:11:27 --> 00:11:37
of remembering it, so the one
mnemonic device, we'll call it

176
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
a mnemonic device here, for
remembering what it is that

177
00:11:41 --> 00:11:48
you're doing, is to remind
yourself of what happens for

178
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
the simplest possible case.
 

179
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
Which is f ( x) = 1.
 

180
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
It seems very modest, but if it
doesn't give you the exact

181
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
answer for f (x) = 1, you've
got the wrong weightings.

182
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
And here, if you check out what
happens in the first formula

183
00:12:06 --> 00:12:13
here, y0 / 2 + y1 +..., well,
we'll go all the way

184
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
to yn - 1 + yn / 2.
 

185
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
If you check that formula
out here, this is the

186
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
trapezoidal rule.
 

187
00:12:21 --> 00:12:26
If you check it out for this
case, then what you get is

188
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
that this is equal to
delta x times what?

189
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
Well, all of these are 1's.
 

190
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
And how many are
there in the middle?

191
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
There are n - 1 of
them in the middle.

192
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
So it's 1/2 + n - 1 + 1/2.
 

193
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
At the tail end.
 

194
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
So all told it's (delta x)( n).
 

195
00:12:43 --> 00:12:50
And I remind you that
delta x = b - a / n.

196
00:12:50 --> 00:12:57
So, delta x, this thing,
is equal to b - a.

197
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
And that's just
as it should be.

198
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
What we just calculated
is an approximation to

199
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
this integral here.
 

200
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
Which is just the area of
the rectangle of base

201
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
b - a and height 1.
 

202
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
Which of course is b - a.
 

203
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
So this is the check that
you got your weighted

204
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
average correct here.
 

205
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
You've put the correct
weightings on everything.

206
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
And you can do this same
thing with Simpson's Rule.

207
00:13:23 --> 00:13:31
And match up those quantities.
 

208
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
There was a question in
the room at some point.

209
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
No, OK.
 

210
00:13:38 --> 00:13:45
So now, the next thing I want
to do for you is the loose

211
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
end which I left hanging.
 

212
00:13:49 --> 00:13:54
Namely, I want to compute
that mysterious constant

213
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
square root of pi / 2.
 

214
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
This is really one of the
most famous computations

215
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
in calculus.
 

216
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
And it's a very,
very clever trick.

217
00:14:04 --> 00:14:09
I certainly don't expect you
to come up with this trick.

218
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
I certainly wouldn't
have myself.

219
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
But it's an important
thing to calculate.

220
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
And it's just very useful.
 

221
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
So I'm going to
tell you about it.

222
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
And it's just on the subject
that we're dealing with in

223
00:14:22 --> 00:14:28
this unit; namely, slicing.
 

224
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
Or adding up.
 

225
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
So the first step, which is
just something that we already

226
00:14:36 --> 00:14:50
did, was that we found the
volume under this curve.

227
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
This bell-shaped
curve, e ^ - r ^2.

228
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
But rotated around an axis.
 

229
00:15:00 --> 00:15:09
Rotated around this axis.
 

230
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
Around this way.
 

231
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
So we figured that out.
 

232
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
And that was a relatively
short computation.

233
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
I'm just going to remind
you, it goes by shells.

234
00:15:18 --> 00:15:23
We integrate the whole
range from 0 to infinity.

235
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
And we have 2 pi r e^ - r ^2
dr. So this again is the

236
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
circumference of the shell.
 

237
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
This is the height of the
shell, and this is the

238
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
thickness of the shell.
 

239
00:15:34 --> 00:15:45
Circumference,
height, thickness.

240
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
So we're just taking a
little piece here and

241
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
sweeping it around.
 

242
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
And then adding up.
 

243
00:15:52 --> 00:15:58
And then this antiderivative
is pi, - pi e^ - r ^2,

244
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
evaluated at 0 and infinity.
 

245
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
And we worked this
out last time.

246
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
This is pi.
 

247
00:16:06 --> 00:16:12
It's pi (1 - 0).
 

248
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
Which is pi.
 

249
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
So the conclusion
is that V = pi.

250
00:16:15 --> 00:16:20
We already know that.
 

251
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
Now, the problem that we want
to deal with now is the problem

252
00:16:23 --> 00:16:31
not of a volume, but an area.
 

253
00:16:31 --> 00:16:32
And this looks quite different.
 

254
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
And of course the answer
is going to be different.

255
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
But let's do it.
 

256
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
So this is this
question mark here.

257
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
And I'm going to do
the one from minus

258
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
infinity to infinity.
 

259
00:16:47 --> 00:16:52
And I'll relate it to what we
talked about earlier in this

260
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
unit, in just a couple of
minutes when I show you the

261
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
procedure that we're
going to follow.

262
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
So here's the quantity and now,
what this is interpreted as is

263
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
the area under this bell curve.
 

264
00:17:07 --> 00:17:22
This time, Q is really an area.
 

265
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
Now, what's going to turn
out to happen, is this.

266
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
This is the trick.
 

267
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
We're going to compute
V in a different way.

268
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
And you'll see it laid
out in just a second.

269
00:17:35 --> 00:17:42
We will compute V by slices.
 

270
00:17:42 --> 00:17:45
We're going to slice it like
a piece of bread here.

271
00:17:45 --> 00:17:48
We're going to solve for
that same thing here.

272
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
And then, amazingly, what's
going to happen is that we

273
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
will discover that V = Q ^2.
 

274
00:17:57 --> 00:18:03
That's going to be what's
going to come out.

275
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
And that's the end of the
computation that we want.

276
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
Because actually we
already know what V is.

277
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
We don't want to read
this equation forward.

278
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
We want to read it
the other way.

279
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
We want to say Q^2 = V, which
we already know is pi.

280
00:18:18 --> 00:18:29
And so Q = the
square root of pi.

281
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
I haven't shown this yet,
this is the weird part.

282
00:18:33 --> 00:18:36
And I'm going to put it in a
little box so that we know that

283
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
this is what we need to check.
 

284
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
We need to check
this fact here.

285
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
We haven't done that yet.
 

286
00:18:45 --> 00:18:51
Now, let me connect this with
what we did a few days ago.

287
00:18:51 --> 00:18:56
With what I called one of
the important functions of

288
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
mathematics besides the
ones you already know.

289
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
And so the function that we
were faced with, and that we

290
00:19:05 --> 00:19:15
discussed, was this one.
 

291
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
And then, we were interested
in the value at infinity.

292
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
We were interested in this.
 

293
00:19:23 --> 00:19:28
Which, if you draw a picture of
it, and you draw the same bell

294
00:19:28 --> 00:19:32
curve, that's the area
under half. of it.

295
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
That's the area starting from
0 and going to infinity.

296
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
That's the area under half.
 

297
00:19:37 --> 00:19:46
So this chunk is F of infinity.
 

298
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
And now I hope that this
part of the connection is

299
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
not meant to be fancy.
 

300
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
The idea here is that
Q = 2 F(infinity).

301
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
This number here.
 

302
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
And so F of infinity = to the
square root of pi / 2, if we

303
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
believe what we said
on the last panel.

304
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
And that was the thing that I
drew a picture of on the board.

305
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
Namely, the graph of
F looked like this.

306
00:20:18 --> 00:20:23
And there was this asymptote,
which was the limit F (x) tends

307
00:20:23 --> 00:20:26
to square root of pi / 2.
 

308
00:20:26 --> 00:20:27
As x goes to infinity.
 

309
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
That was that limiting value.
 

310
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
Which is F of infinity.
 

311
00:20:33 --> 00:20:40
So this is the asymptote.
 

312
00:20:40 --> 00:20:43
And now I've explained the
connection between what we

313
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
claimed to be 4, which was
quite mysterious, and what

314
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
we're actually going to
be able to check now.

315
00:20:50 --> 00:21:07
Concretely, by making
this computation.

316
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
So how in the world can you
get something like this.

317
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
What's in that orange box
there, that V = Q ^2.

318
00:21:14 --> 00:21:19
Again, the technique is
to use slices here.

319
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
And I'm going to have to
draw you a 3-D picture

320
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
to visualize the slice.
 

321
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
Let's do that.
 

322
00:21:27 --> 00:21:31
I'm going to draw three axes
now, because we're now going to

323
00:21:31 --> 00:21:36
be in three-dimensional space,
and I want you to imagine the x

324
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
axis as coming out of the
blackboard, the y axis is

325
00:21:39 --> 00:21:42
horizontal, and there's a new
axis, which I'll call the

326
00:21:42 --> 00:21:45
z axis which is going up.
 

327
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
So what's happening here is
that I'm thinking of this,

328
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
this is, if you like,
some kind of side view.

329
00:21:51 --> 00:21:52
And this is a view where
I've tilted things a

330
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
little bit up to the top.
 

331
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
Now, the distribution, or you
could think of this target in

332
00:22:01 --> 00:22:03
the plane, where the most
likely places to hit were in

333
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
the middle and it died off.
 

334
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
As we went down.
 

335
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
Now, I want to draw a
picture of this graph.

336
00:22:11 --> 00:22:15
I'm going to draw a picture
of e^ - r squared.

337
00:22:15 --> 00:22:18
And it's basically a hump.
 

338
00:22:18 --> 00:22:22
So I'm going to take the
first, the slice along y = 0.

339
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
The y = 0 slice.
 

340
00:22:23 --> 00:22:26
And I claim that that
goes up like this.

341
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
And then comes back down.
 

342
00:22:28 --> 00:22:32
Let me shade this in, so
that you can see what

343
00:22:32 --> 00:22:34
kind of a slice this is.
 

344
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
This is supposed to be along
this vertical plane here.

345
00:22:39 --> 00:22:40
Which is coming out of
the blackboard and

346
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
coming towards you.
 

347
00:22:42 --> 00:22:43
And that's a slice.
 

348
00:22:43 --> 00:22:46
Now, I'm going to draw one
more slice so that you

349
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
can see what's happening.
 

350
00:22:49 --> 00:22:52
I'm going to draw a
slice at another place.

351
00:22:52 --> 00:22:52
Along here.
 

352
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
This will be y = b.
 

353
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
Some other level.
 

354
00:22:56 --> 00:22:58
And now I'm going to
show you what happens.

355
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
What happens is that the hump
dies down a little bit.

356
00:23:02 --> 00:23:06
So the bump is just
a little bit lower.

357
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
And it's going to look a
little bit the same way.

358
00:23:10 --> 00:23:11
But it's just going
to be a bit smaller.

359
00:23:11 --> 00:23:15
So there's another slice here.
 

360
00:23:15 --> 00:23:16
Like that.
 

361
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
And I want to give a
name to these slices.

362
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25
I'm going to call this A ( b).
 

363
00:23:25 --> 00:23:36
That is, the area
of the b slice.

364
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
Under the surface.
 

365
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
OK Yes, question.
 

366
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

367
00:23:47 --> 00:23:48
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the solid.
 

368
00:23:48 --> 00:23:48
Yeah.
 

369
00:23:48 --> 00:23:53
We're trying to figure out this
volume here, which is the one

370
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
we started out with, by slices.
 

371
00:23:56 --> 00:23:59
So first I have to think of,
I'm going to visualize.

372
00:23:59 --> 00:24:01
So here I didn't
even visualize.

373
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
I took a cross section and I
thought about how to spin it

374
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
around without actually
doing that in

375
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
three-dimensional space.
 

376
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
But now I'm going to take a
different kind of slice.

377
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
I'm going to take that
same bump, which is a

378
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
three-dimensional object.
 

379
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
I'm going to lay it
down on a plane.

380
00:24:16 --> 00:24:17
Which looks like this.
 

381
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
And then it's a bump here.
 

382
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
It's a hump.
 

383
00:24:22 --> 00:24:27
And now I'm going to try to
slice it by various planes.

384
00:24:27 --> 00:24:29
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

385
00:24:29 --> 00:24:36
PROFESSOR: So one way of
defining the bump, as you just

386
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
suggested, is you take this
curve and you rotate it

387
00:24:38 --> 00:24:39
around this z-axis.
 

388
00:24:39 --> 00:24:41
So in other words, you make
this the axis of rotation,

389
00:24:41 --> 00:24:43
you spin it around.
 

390
00:24:43 --> 00:24:44
That's correct.
 

391
00:24:44 --> 00:24:48
So that shows you that the
peaks as you go down here are

392
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
going to descend the same way.
 

393
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
But I don't want to
draw those lines.

394
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
I want to imagine what
the parallel slices are.

395
00:24:57 --> 00:24:59
Because I don't want
to get cross slices.

396
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
I want all slices parallel
to the same thing.

397
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

398
00:25:05 --> 00:25:05
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

399
00:25:05 --> 00:25:13
This is not particularly
easy to visualize.

400
00:25:13 --> 00:25:17
Now, here's the formula
for volume by slices.

401
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
The formula for volume by
slices is that you add up

402
00:25:23 --> 00:25:28
the areas of the slices.
 

403
00:25:28 --> 00:25:31
That's how you do it.
 

404
00:25:31 --> 00:25:32
You take each slice.
 

405
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
You add the cross-sectional
area, and then you take a

406
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
little thickness, dy, and
then you add all of them up.

407
00:25:38 --> 00:25:41
Because this is extending over
the whole plane, we're going to

408
00:25:41 --> 00:25:43
have to go all the way from
minus infinity to

409
00:25:43 --> 00:25:45
plus infinity.
 

410
00:25:45 --> 00:25:56
And this is the formula
for volumes by slicing.

411
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
And now our goal, in order to
do this calculation, we're

412
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
going to just fix y = some b.
 

413
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
We're just going to fix
one of these slices.

414
00:26:06 --> 00:26:13
And we're going to
calculate A ( b).

415
00:26:13 --> 00:26:16
That's what we need to do
in order to make this

416
00:26:16 --> 00:26:23
procedure succeed.
 

417
00:26:23 --> 00:26:27
This is the only place
where this method works.

418
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
But it's an important one.
 

419
00:26:32 --> 00:26:35
In order to make it work,
I'm going to have to again

420
00:26:35 --> 00:26:37
draw the plot from a
different point of view.

421
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
I'm going to do the top view.
 

422
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
So I want to look down
on this x-y plane here.

423
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
This is the x direction, and
here's the y direction.

424
00:26:52 --> 00:26:56
And then again I want
to draw my slice.

425
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
My slice is here.
 

426
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
At y = b.
 

427
00:27:04 --> 00:27:07
So we're just right
on top of it.

428
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
And it's coming up at
some kind of bump.

429
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
Here, with a little higher
in the middle and going

430
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
down on the sides.
 

431
00:27:15 --> 00:27:20
Now, the formula for
the height is this.

432
00:27:20 --> 00:27:25
If I take a distance r here,
the formula for the height

433
00:27:25 --> 00:27:31
of the bump is e ^ - r ^2.
 

434
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
I'll store that over
here. e ^ - r ^2 is the

435
00:27:35 --> 00:27:37
height at this place.
 

436
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
If this distance to
the origin is r.

437
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
That's true all the way around.
 

438
00:27:43 --> 00:27:48
And in terms of b and x,
we can figure out that

439
00:27:48 --> 00:27:49
by this right triangle.
 

440
00:27:49 --> 00:27:52
This height is b, and
this distance is x.

441
00:27:52 --> 00:28:02
So r ^2 = b ^2 + x ^2.
 

442
00:28:02 --> 00:28:02
Question.
 

443
00:28:02 --> 00:28:15
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

444
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
PROFESSOR: The question is,
is that the x-y plane.

445
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
So the answer is that over here
I cleverly used the letter r.

446
00:28:23 --> 00:28:27
I avoided using y's
and z's or anything.

447
00:28:27 --> 00:28:28
And over here, this
is the distance r.

448
00:28:28 --> 00:28:31
And you like this,
is z, going up.

449
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
That's the way to think of it.
 

450
00:28:33 --> 00:28:36
So that all of the
letters are consistent.

451
00:28:36 --> 00:28:39
So I just avoided
giving it a name.

452
00:28:39 --> 00:28:41
That's good, that's
exactly the point.

453
00:28:41 --> 00:28:43
Alright.
 

454
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
So now, I claim I have
a formula for r ^2.

455
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
And so I can write this down.
 

456
00:28:48 --> 00:28:58
This is e ^ - (b ^2 + x ^2).
 

457
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
But now I'm going to use
the rule of exponents.

458
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
Which is that this is the same
as (e ^ - b ^2) ( e^ - x^2).

459
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
And that's going to be the
main way in which we use the

460
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15
particular function that
we're dealing with here.

461
00:29:15 --> 00:29:20
That's really the main
step, amazingly.

462
00:29:20 --> 00:29:33
So now I get to compute
what A ( b) is.

463
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
A( b) is the area
under a curve.

464
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
So it's going to be, let me
write it over here, A(b) is the

465
00:29:41 --> 00:29:47
area under this curve here.
 

466
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
Which is some constant times,
so if you imagine, call

467
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
this thing the name c.
 

468
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
Under some curve, c e ^ - x ^2.
 

469
00:29:57 --> 00:30:06
Where the c = e^ - b ^2.
 

470
00:30:06 --> 00:30:07
That's what our slice is.
 

471
00:30:07 --> 00:30:09
In fact, it looks
like one of those.

472
00:30:09 --> 00:30:12
It looks like one
of those bumps.

473
00:30:12 --> 00:30:14
Here's its formula again.
 

474
00:30:14 --> 00:30:19
It's the integral from minus
infinity to infinity of (e^

475
00:30:19 --> 00:30:28
- b ^2)( e ^ - x ^2) dx.
 

476
00:30:28 --> 00:30:31
We just recopied what
I had up there.

477
00:30:31 --> 00:30:37
And this is the height at each
value of x, with b fixed.

478
00:30:37 --> 00:30:42
And now, so we have a
lot of steps here.

479
00:30:42 --> 00:30:44
But each of them is
very elementary.

480
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
The first one was just
that law of exponents.

481
00:30:47 --> 00:30:49
That we could split the
two into products.

482
00:30:49 --> 00:30:51
Now I'm going to make that
splitting even further.

483
00:30:51 --> 00:30:53
This is a constant.
 

484
00:30:53 --> 00:30:55
It's not varying with x.
 

485
00:30:55 --> 00:30:59
So I'm going to factor
it out of the integral.

486
00:30:59 --> 00:31:02
This is e ^ - b ^2 times the
integral from minus infinity

487
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
to infinity of e^ -x^2 dx.
 

488
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
So this might look frightening,
but actually it's just the

489
00:31:10 --> 00:31:11
property of an integral.
 

490
00:31:11 --> 00:31:13
All integrals have this
kind of property.

491
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
You can always factor
out a constant.

492
00:31:17 --> 00:31:20
And now here comes the
remarkable thing.

493
00:31:20 --> 00:31:24
This is e ^ - b^2 times
a number which is

494
00:31:24 --> 00:31:26
now familiar to us.
 

495
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
What is this number?
 

496
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
This is what we're looking for.
 

497
00:31:29 --> 00:31:38
This is our unknown, Q.
 

498
00:31:38 --> 00:31:41
So I've computed A(b), and
now I'm ready to finish

499
00:31:41 --> 00:31:43
the problem off.
 

500
00:31:43 --> 00:31:47
A (b) = ( e^ - b^2) Q.
 

501
00:31:47 --> 00:31:49
Q is that strange number
which we don't know yet.

502
00:31:49 --> 00:31:51
What it is.
 

503
00:31:51 --> 00:31:55
So now I'm going to
compute the whole volume.

504
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
The whole volume, remember,
it's over there, it's minus

505
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
infinity to infinity,
A ( y) dy.

506
00:32:02 --> 00:32:04
And now I'm just going
to plug in the formula

507
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06
that we've found for a.
 

508
00:32:06 --> 00:32:08
Now I'm doing this for
each b, so I'm doing it

509
00:32:08 --> 00:32:09
varying over all b's.
 

510
00:32:09 --> 00:32:12
So I have the integral from
minus infinity to infinity.

511
00:32:12 --> 00:32:15
And here I have e^ - y ^2.
 

512
00:32:15 --> 00:32:17
I've replaced b by y.
 

513
00:32:17 --> 00:32:19
And now I have Q.
 

514
00:32:19 --> 00:32:21
And I have dy.
 

515
00:32:21 --> 00:32:24
I just recopied what I
had over there into the

516
00:32:24 --> 00:32:27
formula for slicing.
 

517
00:32:27 --> 00:32:30
And now, I'm going to do this
trick of factoring out the

518
00:32:30 --> 00:32:32
constant a second time.
 

519
00:32:32 --> 00:32:33
This is a constant.
 

520
00:32:33 --> 00:32:35
It doesn't depend on y.
 

521
00:32:35 --> 00:32:38
It's the same for all y,
it just will factor out.

522
00:32:38 --> 00:32:40
So this is the same as Q times
the integral from minus

523
00:32:40 --> 00:32:47
infinity to infinity,
e ^ - y ^2 dy.

524
00:32:47 --> 00:32:52
And now, lo and behold,
this expression here.

525
00:32:52 --> 00:32:54
Of course, notice
how I defined Q.

526
00:32:54 --> 00:32:56
Let's go back carefully
to where Q is defined.

527
00:32:56 --> 00:33:01
Here's Q.
 

528
00:33:01 --> 00:33:02
This t is a dummy variable.
 

529
00:33:02 --> 00:33:04
It doesn't matter
what I call it.

530
00:33:04 --> 00:33:06
I can call it x, I can call
it u, I can call it v.

531
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
In this case, I've given
it two different names.

532
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
At this stage, I called it x.
 

533
00:33:13 --> 00:33:14
And at this stage
I'm calling it y.

534
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
But it's the same variable.
 

535
00:33:17 --> 00:33:20
And so this little chunk is Q
and altogether I have two of

536
00:33:20 --> 00:33:23
them, for Q ^2 being the total.
 

537
00:33:23 --> 00:33:32
And that's the end
of the argument.

538
00:33:32 --> 00:33:33
It's a real miracle.
 

539
00:33:33 --> 00:33:45
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

540
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
PROFESSOR: Great question.
 

541
00:33:47 --> 00:33:49
The question is, wait a minute.
 

542
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
As y changes, doesn't x change.
 

543
00:33:53 --> 00:33:58
And so then this
wouldn't be a constant.

544
00:33:58 --> 00:34:01
So that's the way in which
we've used the letters x and

545
00:34:01 --> 00:34:04
y in this whole course.
 

546
00:34:04 --> 00:34:07
When you get to 18.02, you'll
almost never do that.

547
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
Always y and x will be
different variables.

548
00:34:11 --> 00:34:12
And they won't have to
depend on each other.

549
00:34:12 --> 00:34:15
Now, let me show you where
on this picture the

550
00:34:15 --> 00:34:17
x and the y are.
 

551
00:34:17 --> 00:34:20
We've got a whole x-y plain,
and here I'm fixing y

552
00:34:20 --> 00:34:23
= b, y isn't varying.
 

553
00:34:23 --> 00:34:25
Whereas x is changing.
 

554
00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
So, in other words, I don't
have a relationship between

555
00:34:27 --> 00:34:29
x and y, unless I fix it.
 

556
00:34:29 --> 00:34:32
In this case I've decided that
y is going to be constant.

557
00:34:32 --> 00:34:35
For all x.
 

558
00:34:35 --> 00:34:39
Over here, I made
a computation.

559
00:34:39 --> 00:34:41
And I have a Q, which is
just a single number.

560
00:34:41 --> 00:34:44
No matter which b I took,
it didn't matter which.

561
00:34:44 --> 00:34:46
No matter which y = b.
 

562
00:34:46 --> 00:34:48
Of course, I changed the
name to b so it wouldn't

563
00:34:48 --> 00:34:50
be so jarring to you.
 

564
00:34:50 --> 00:34:53
But in fact this b
was y all along.

565
00:34:53 --> 00:34:56
It's just that the x
varied completely

566
00:34:56 --> 00:34:57
independently of the y.
 

567
00:34:57 --> 00:35:00
I could fix the y and
vary the x, I could fix

568
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
the x and vary the y.
 

569
00:35:03 --> 00:35:06
So it's a different
use of the letters.

570
00:35:06 --> 00:35:07
From what you're used to.
 

571
00:35:07 --> 00:35:10
It happens that y is
not a function of x.

572
00:35:10 --> 00:35:11
In this case.
 

573
00:35:11 --> 00:35:11
Yes.
 

574
00:35:11 --> 00:35:16
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

575
00:35:16 --> 00:35:17
PROFESSOR: Yes.
 

576
00:35:17 --> 00:35:23
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

577
00:35:23 --> 00:35:26
PROFESSOR: The question is,
because I'm rotating around

578
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
the z axis, doesn't x change
exactly as much as y does.

579
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
What happens is that x and
y are symmetric variables.

580
00:35:33 --> 00:35:36
They can be treated equally.
 

581
00:35:36 --> 00:35:41
But if I decide to take slices
with respect to y being fixed

582
00:35:41 --> 00:35:45
and x varying, then of course
they're now separated, and I

583
00:35:45 --> 00:35:48
have a separate role for the x
and a separate role for the y.

584
00:35:48 --> 00:35:50
Or if I'd sliced it the
other way, I would have

585
00:35:50 --> 00:35:51
gotten the same answer.
 

586
00:35:51 --> 00:35:54
I just would have reversed
the roles of x and y.

587
00:35:54 --> 00:35:57
So what's happening is
that x and y are on equal

588
00:35:57 --> 00:35:59
footing with each other.
 

589
00:35:59 --> 00:36:02
In this picture, and I could've
sliced the other way.

590
00:36:02 --> 00:36:04
It would have gotten
the same answer.

591
00:36:04 --> 00:36:07
That's more or less the
answer to your question.

592
00:36:07 --> 00:36:13
OK.
 

593
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
Now I have given you a review
sheet, and I want to run

594
00:36:17 --> 00:36:23
through, briefly, what's
going to be on the exam.

595
00:36:23 --> 00:36:28
And this list of exam
questions is what's

596
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
going to be on the exam.
 

597
00:36:30 --> 00:36:33
There are, sorry this is
not displayed correctly.

598
00:36:33 --> 00:36:35
So, exam questions, but now
I'm just going to show

599
00:36:35 --> 00:36:36
you what they are.
 

600
00:36:36 --> 00:36:38
There are five
questions on the exam.

601
00:36:38 --> 00:36:46
They are completely parallel
to what you got last year.

602
00:36:46 --> 00:36:48
So you should look
at that test.

603
00:36:48 --> 00:36:50
It's worth looking at.
 

604
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
And you'll see in the
descriptions on this sheet

605
00:36:54 --> 00:37:00
that what I'm describing
is what's on that test.

606
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
So what's going to happen is,
and this is also posted on the

607
00:37:04 --> 00:37:10
Web, is that you'll be expected
to calculate some definite

608
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
integrals using the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

609
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
Do a numerical approximation.
 

610
00:37:16 --> 00:37:17
There'll be a Riemann,
a trapezoidal rule

611
00:37:17 --> 00:37:19
and a Simpson's Rule.
 

612
00:37:19 --> 00:37:22
Calculate areas and volumes.
 

613
00:37:22 --> 00:37:25
And then some other
cumulative sum.

614
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
Either an average value or
probability or perhaps work.

615
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
And sketch a function
which is given in this

616
00:37:33 --> 00:37:37
form as an integral.
 

617
00:37:37 --> 00:37:42
So those are the questions,
and you'll see by the

618
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
example of last year's
exam exactly the style.

619
00:37:46 --> 00:37:48
They're really going
to be very similar.

620
00:37:48 --> 00:37:49
Yes, question.
 

621
00:37:49 --> 00:38:01
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

622
00:38:01 --> 00:38:02
PROFESSOR: OK, good question.
 

623
00:38:02 --> 00:38:06
So the question is, for Riemann
sums, what's the difference

624
00:38:06 --> 00:38:19
between upper and lower,
and right and left?

625
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
So here we have a Riemann sum.
 

626
00:38:25 --> 00:38:30
And I'm going to give you a
picture which is, maybe this

627
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
function y = 1 / x, which was
the one that we were

628
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
discussing earlier.
 

629
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
If you take the function y = 1
/ x and you break it up into

630
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
pieces here, however it doesn't
matter how many pieces, let's

631
00:38:45 --> 00:38:48
just say there are
four of them.

632
00:38:48 --> 00:38:53
Then the lower Riemann sum
is the staircase which

633
00:38:53 --> 00:38:55
fits underneath.
 

634
00:38:55 --> 00:39:01
So this one is a picture
of the lower sum.

635
00:39:01 --> 00:39:03
It's always less.
 

636
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
And in the case of a decreasing
function, it's going to be, so

637
00:39:09 --> 00:39:20
since if you like, since 1 / x
decreases, the lower sum

638
00:39:20 --> 00:39:27
equals the right sum.
 

639
00:39:27 --> 00:39:29
You can see that visually
on this picture.

640
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
The values you're going to
select are going to be the

641
00:39:33 --> 00:39:38
right ends of the rectangles.
 

642
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
The upper sum is the left one.
 

643
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
Now, if the function wiggles up
and down, then you have to pick

644
00:39:44 --> 00:39:45
whichever side is appropriate.
 

645
00:39:45 --> 00:39:47
Or maybe it'll be a point in
the middle, if the maximum

646
00:39:47 --> 00:39:54
is achieved in the middle.
 

647
00:39:54 --> 00:39:55
Yeah, another question.
 

648
00:39:55 --> 00:40:02
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

649
00:40:02 --> 00:40:03
PROFESSOR: Correct.
 

650
00:40:03 --> 00:40:09
If the function is increasing,
then the lower sum

651
00:40:09 --> 00:40:11
is the left sum.
 

652
00:40:11 --> 00:40:13
So it just exactly
reverses what's here.

653
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
So this is decreasing, lower
sum is right-hand sum.

654
00:40:17 --> 00:40:24
Increasing, lower sum
is left-hand sum.

655
00:40:24 --> 00:40:26
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

656
00:40:26 --> 00:40:26
PROFESSOR: Yes.
 

657
00:40:26 --> 00:40:44
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

658
00:40:44 --> 00:40:45
PROFESSOR: Good question.
 

659
00:40:45 --> 00:40:47
Suppose you're faced with
a function like this

660
00:40:47 --> 00:40:48
in this last problem.
 

661
00:40:48 --> 00:40:52
Which, generally, these are
the trickiest problems.

662
00:40:52 --> 00:40:54
And the question is, how are
you ever going to be able to

663
00:40:54 --> 00:40:58
decide on an asymptote, even
whether there is an asymptote.

664
00:40:58 --> 00:41:01
And the answer is, you're not.
 

665
00:41:01 --> 00:41:05
It's going to be pretty
tricky to get keep track

666
00:41:05 --> 00:41:07
of what's happening as
it goes to infinity.

667
00:41:07 --> 00:41:09
We had an example on the
homework where is was

668
00:41:09 --> 00:41:12
oscillating and it's very
unclear what's going on.

669
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
You have to do a very
long analysis for that.

670
00:41:15 --> 00:41:21
So in fact, just don't
worry about that now.

671
00:41:21 --> 00:41:23
At the very end of the class,
we'll talk a little bit

672
00:41:23 --> 00:41:24
about these asymptotes.
 

673
00:41:24 --> 00:41:27
And really, the first issue is
whether they exist or not.

674
00:41:27 --> 00:41:30
And that's even something.
 

675
00:41:30 --> 00:41:32
That's a serious question
which we'll address at the

676
00:41:32 --> 00:41:33
very end of this course.
 

677
00:41:33 --> 00:41:36
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

678
00:41:36 --> 00:41:36
PROFESSOR: That's right.
 

679
00:41:36 --> 00:41:40
It's not going to be
anything that complicated.

680
00:41:40 --> 00:41:42
Other questions?
 

681
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
We we still have a five whole
minutes, and I have an example

682
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
to give, if nobody
has a question.

683
00:41:50 --> 00:41:50
Yeah.
 

684
00:41:50 --> 00:41:51
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

685
00:41:51 --> 00:41:56
PROFESSOR: The question,
uh, will I tell you which

686
00:41:56 --> 00:42:00
one of what to use?
 

687
00:42:00 --> 00:42:00
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

688
00:42:00 --> 00:42:02
PROFESSOR: When I tell you the
numeric approximation is,

689
00:42:02 --> 00:42:04
you'll see on the exam.
 

690
00:42:04 --> 00:42:06
The practice exam
that you have.

691
00:42:06 --> 00:42:09
I will ask you for all three.
 

692
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
I will ask you for the Riemann
sum, the trapezoidal rule,

693
00:42:11 --> 00:42:12
and the Simpson's rule.
 

694
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
I'm guaranteeing you they'll
all three be on the exam.

695
00:42:16 --> 00:42:18
I'm guaranteeing that every
single thing which is on that

696
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
piece of paper is on the exam.
 

697
00:42:20 --> 00:42:23
And you'll see it on the
exam that you've got.

698
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
It's exactly parallel
to what's there.

699
00:42:27 --> 00:42:31
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

700
00:42:31 --> 00:42:34
PROFESSOR: So with areas and
volume, the question is will I

701
00:42:34 --> 00:42:36
tell you which method to use.
 

702
00:42:36 --> 00:42:48
So let's discuss that.
 

703
00:42:48 --> 00:42:58
So with areas and volumes,
there's basically, so this

704
00:42:58 --> 00:43:00
is always true with areas.
 

705
00:43:00 --> 00:43:07
And it's true with
volumes of revolution.

706
00:43:07 --> 00:43:08
By the way you should
read this sheet.

707
00:43:08 --> 00:43:12
Not everything that's on
here is, have I said.

708
00:43:12 --> 00:43:15
But you should read it.
 

709
00:43:15 --> 00:43:16
Because it's all relevant.
 

710
00:43:16 --> 00:43:19
So with volumes of revolution,
you always work your way

711
00:43:19 --> 00:43:25
back to some 2-D diagram.
 

712
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
So there's some 2-D diagram
which is always two-dimensional

713
00:43:31 --> 00:43:34
diagram, which is always
connected with these problems.

714
00:43:34 --> 00:43:37
I mean, something this hard
is really just too hard

715
00:43:37 --> 00:43:39
to do on an exam, right?
 

716
00:43:39 --> 00:43:40
I mean, I'm not going to
ask you something this

717
00:43:40 --> 00:43:42
complicated on the exam.
 

718
00:43:42 --> 00:43:44
Because this involves
a three-dimensional

719
00:43:44 --> 00:43:47
visualization.
 

720
00:43:47 --> 00:43:50
But once you're down to
2-D, you're supposed to

721
00:43:50 --> 00:43:52
be able to handle it.
 

722
00:43:52 --> 00:43:54
Now, what's the main
issue after you've

723
00:43:54 --> 00:43:56
got your 2-D diagram?
 

724
00:43:56 --> 00:43:59
The main issue is, do you
want to integrate with

725
00:43:59 --> 00:44:06
respect to dx or dy?
 

726
00:44:06 --> 00:44:13
And the answer is
that it will depend.

727
00:44:13 --> 00:44:18
And if there's one that's going
to cause you incredible

728
00:44:18 --> 00:44:23
difficulty, and I feel that
you're not able to dodge it,

729
00:44:23 --> 00:44:26
then I might give you a hint
and say you'd better use

730
00:44:26 --> 00:44:30
shells, or you'd better
use disks or washers or

731
00:44:30 --> 00:44:31
something like that.
 

732
00:44:31 --> 00:44:35
But if I feel that you're grown
up enough to figure out which

733
00:44:35 --> 00:44:37
one it is, because one of them
is so ridiculous you say

734
00:44:37 --> 00:44:39
forget it, immediately.
 

735
00:44:39 --> 00:44:40
After thinking about it.
 

736
00:44:40 --> 00:44:43
Then I won't tell
you which one.

737
00:44:43 --> 00:44:45
Because I figure, in other
words, I don't want you

738
00:44:45 --> 00:44:47
to waste your time.
 

739
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
But I'm willing to waste a
minute or two of your time

740
00:44:50 --> 00:44:57
on a wild goose chase.
 

741
00:44:57 --> 00:45:01
So let me give you
an example of this.

742
00:45:01 --> 00:45:14
Suppose you're looking at
the curve y < 0 < - x^3.

743
00:45:14 --> 00:45:17
So this is some kind of lump.
 

744
00:45:17 --> 00:45:18
Like this.
 

745
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
It goes from 0 to 1, because
the right-hand side

746
00:45:22 --> 00:45:26
is 0 at 0 and 1 here.
 

747
00:45:26 --> 00:45:26
It's some kind of thing.
 

748
00:45:26 --> 00:45:29
And there are these
two possibilities.

749
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
One of them is to do shells.
 

750
00:45:33 --> 00:45:36
And then, so this is
supposed to be rotated

751
00:45:36 --> 00:45:41
around the y axis.
 

752
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
In this case.
 

753
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
And the same would apply,
actually, to the area problem.

754
00:45:49 --> 00:45:50
So I'm doing a slightly
more complicated problem.

755
00:45:50 --> 00:45:52
But you could ask for the
area underneath this.

756
00:45:52 --> 00:45:53
So forth.
 

757
00:45:53 --> 00:45:54
OK.
 

758
00:45:54 --> 00:45:57
So we can integrate this dx,
or we can integrate this dy.

759
00:45:57 --> 00:46:00
This indicates that I'm
deciding that this is going

760
00:46:00 --> 00:46:02
to be of thickness dx,
and I'm integrating dx.

761
00:46:02 --> 00:46:04
So that's a choice
that I'm making.

762
00:46:04 --> 00:46:08
Now, the minute I made
that choice I know

763
00:46:08 --> 00:46:10
that these are shells.
 

764
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
Because they sweep around this
way and that makes them shells.

765
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
Cylindrical shells.
 

766
00:46:15 --> 00:46:19
And if I do that,
the setup is this.

767
00:46:19 --> 00:46:25
It's 2 pi x ( x - x ^3) dx.
 

768
00:46:25 --> 00:46:28
Now, I claim that when you
get to this point, you

769
00:46:28 --> 00:46:30
already know you've won.
 

770
00:46:30 --> 00:46:32
Because this is an easy
integral to calculate.

771
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
So you're done here.
 

772
00:46:34 --> 00:46:37
You're happy.
 

773
00:46:37 --> 00:46:42
Now, if you happened to say,
oh gee, I hate to do this.

774
00:46:42 --> 00:46:48
I want to do something clever,
you could try to do it

775
00:46:48 --> 00:46:54
with cutting this way.
 

776
00:46:54 --> 00:46:56
Let's do this.
 

777
00:46:56 --> 00:47:01
And this would be
the dy thickness.

778
00:47:01 --> 00:47:05
And then when you sweep
this around, you get

779
00:47:05 --> 00:47:10
what we call a washer.
 

780
00:47:10 --> 00:47:14
Which is really just the
difference of two disks.

781
00:47:14 --> 00:47:24
So the shape here is this
thing swung around this axis.

782
00:47:24 --> 00:47:26
And it looks like this.
 

783
00:47:26 --> 00:47:29
So it's going to be the
difference of radii.

784
00:47:29 --> 00:47:32
So what's the formula for this?
 

785
00:47:32 --> 00:47:37
It's some integral of pi times
the right end, which I'll

786
00:47:37 --> 00:47:40
call x2, and here the left
end, which I'll call x1.

787
00:47:40 --> 00:47:47
So this is pi (x2
^2 - x1 ^2) dy.

788
00:47:47 --> 00:47:50
Now, already at this stage,
you think to yourself

789
00:47:50 --> 00:47:54
this is more complicated
than the other method.

790
00:47:54 --> 00:47:56
So you've already abandoned it.
 

791
00:47:56 --> 00:47:59
But I'm just going to go one
step further into this one

792
00:47:59 --> 00:48:01
to see what it is
that's happening.

793
00:48:01 --> 00:48:08
If you try to figure out what
these values x1 and x2 are,

794
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
that corresponds to solving
for x1 and x2 in terms of y.

795
00:48:14 --> 00:48:21
So that's the following
equation. x1 and x2 solve

796
00:48:21 --> 00:48:32
the equation that the
curve, x - x^3 = y.

797
00:48:32 --> 00:48:33
Now, look at this equation.
 

798
00:48:33 --> 00:48:42
That's the equation x ^3 -
sorry, x ^3 - x + y, I guess.

799
00:48:42 --> 00:48:43
Let's see.
 

800
00:48:43 --> 00:48:46
Yeah, that's right,
is equal to 0.

801
00:48:46 --> 00:48:53
This is a cubic equation.
 

802
00:48:53 --> 00:48:55
Although there is a
formula for this.

803
00:48:55 --> 00:48:57
You've never been taught the
formula for this equation.

804
00:48:57 --> 00:49:00
So therefore, you will never,
ever be able to get a formula

805
00:49:00 --> 00:49:02
for x2 and x1 as
a function of y.

806
00:49:02 --> 00:49:05
And you'll never be able
to compute this one.

807
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
This is more than just a dead
end, it's like crash, burn,

808
00:49:08 --> 00:49:11
and, you know self-destruct.
 

809
00:49:11 --> 00:49:14
So there may be such a
thing, so do the other way.

810
00:49:14 --> 00:49:17
Good luck, folks.
 

811
00:49:17 --> 00:49:18
