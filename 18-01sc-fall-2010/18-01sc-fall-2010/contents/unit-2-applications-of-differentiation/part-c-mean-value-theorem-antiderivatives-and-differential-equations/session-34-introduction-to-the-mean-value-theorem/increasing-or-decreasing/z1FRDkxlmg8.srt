00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,850
In this video, what
I'd like us to do

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,400
is answer the
following question.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,730
Suppose that f is a continuous,
differentiable function.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,930
And if it's derivative,
if f prime is never 0,

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,010
and a is not equal to
b, then show that f of a

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,640
is not equal to f of b.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm going to let you think
about it for a while,

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,490
see if you can come up with
a good reason for that,

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,323
and then I'll be back
to explain my reasons.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,510
OK.

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,300
Our object, again,
is to show, if f

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,290
is continuous and differentiable
and its derivative is never 0

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,200
and you're looking at two
x-values that are different,

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,217
show that their y-values
have to be different.

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,800
Show that if the
inputs are different,

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,256
the outputs have
to be different.

18
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,880
Now, this might remind
you of something

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,882
you saw in lecture about if
the derivative has a sign,

20
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,396
show the function-- if the
derivative is positive,

21
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,020
show the function is
always increasing,

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,394
or if the derivative
is negative,

23
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:06,160
show the function is
always decreasing.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,340
So this is a similar
type of problem to that.

25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,010
So what we're going to use
is actually the mean value

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,880
theorem.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,690
If you'll notice, I have f.

28
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,380
It does satisfy the
mean value theorem

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,220
on an interval from a to b.

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,420
I haven't even specified
which is bigger, a or b.

31
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,350
But it doesn't
matter in this case.

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,280
So what do we know?

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,290
The mean value theorem tells
us that if we look at-- well,

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,990
let's just write it out-- f of
b minus f of a over b minus a

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,830
is equal to f prime
of c-- and what

36
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,200
do we know-- for
c between a and b.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,300
So we want to know whether
or not f of b minus f of a

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,320
can ever be 0.

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,740
We're trying to show
that it cannot be 0.

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,960
So we're going to isolate this
expression and show that this

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,530
subtraction cannot be 0.

42
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,530
Well, how do we do that?

43
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,427
Let me come over here to
give us a little more room.

44
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,260
I'm going to rewrite
the mean value theorem.

45
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,331
I'm going to multiply
through by b minus a.

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,460
So we get f prime
of c time b minus a.

47
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,090
Now, we just want
to show, again,

48
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,530
that f of b minus
f of a cannot be 0.

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,570
What's the only thing--
well, not only thing,

50
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,570
we know two things-- what
two things do we know?

51
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,350
We know f prime of c is not 0.

52
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,380
That was given to you.

53
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,360
f prime is never 0, so
certainly at any fixed value,

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
f prime of c is not 0.

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,860
So we know this term is not 0.

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,720
We also know that b
is not equal to a,

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,160
so we know b minus a is not 0.

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,170
The only way to get a product
of two numbers to be 0

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,380
is if one of them is 0.

60
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,007
So this in fact, this
product is not equal to 0.

61
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,840
The fact that this
product is not equal to 0

62
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,950
tells us f of b minus f
of a is not equal to 0.

63
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,600
And that alone is enough
to conclude that f of b

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,024
is not equal to f of a.

65
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,690
So, again, let me
just point out of this

66
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,140
is probably reminds you very
much of the type of thing

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,860
you've seen where you were
showing if f prime had a sign,

68
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,400
then you could determine whether
f was increasing or decreasing.

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
It's the same type
of problem as that.

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,180
It's exploiting what the
mean value theorem tells you.

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,835
So I think we'll stop there.
