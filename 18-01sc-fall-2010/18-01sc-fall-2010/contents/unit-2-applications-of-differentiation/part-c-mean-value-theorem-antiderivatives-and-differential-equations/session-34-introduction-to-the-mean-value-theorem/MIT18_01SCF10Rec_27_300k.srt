00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to recitation.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,560
In this video, what I'd like
us to do is answer the

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,400
following question.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,950
Suppose that f is a continuous,

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,730
differentiable function.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,730
And if it's derivative, if f
prime is never 0, and a is not

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,680
equal to b, then show that f of
a is not equal to f of b.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,940
I'm going to let you think about
it for a while, see if

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,850
you can come up with a good
reason for that, and then I'll

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,140
be back to explain my reasons.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:38,160

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,510
OK.

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,890
Our object, again, is to show,
if f is a continuous and

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,550
differentiable and its
derivative is never 0 and

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,580
you're looking at two x values
that are different, show that

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,480
their y values have
to be different.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,430
Show that if the inputs are
different, the outputs have to

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,300
be different.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,010
Now, this might remind you of
something you saw in lecture

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,720
about if the derivative has a
sign, show the function, if

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,420
the derivative is positive, show
the function is always

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,200
increasing, or if the derivative
is negative, show

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,160
the function is always
decreasing.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,340
So this is a similar type
of problem to that.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,470
So what we're going
to use is actually

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,880
the mean value theorem.

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,690
If you'll notice, I have f.

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,560
It does satisfy the mean
value theorem on an

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,220
interval from a to b.

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,420
I haven't even specified which
is bigger, a or b.

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,350
But it doesn't matter
in this case.

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,280
So what do we know?

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,290
The mean value theorem tells us
that if we look at-- well,

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,990
let's just write it out-- f of
b minus f of a over b minus a

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,610
is equal to f prime of c--

37
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,200
and what do we know-- for
c between a and b.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,100

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,030
So we want to know whether
or not f of b minus f of

40
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,320
a can ever be 0.

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,740
We're trying to show that
it cannot be 0.

42
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,960
So we're going to isolate this
expression and show that this

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,800
subtraction cannot be 0.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,530
Well, how do we do that?

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,670
Let me come over here to give
us a little more room.

46
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,260
I'm going to rewrite the
mean value theorem.

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,331
I'm going to multiply through
by b minus a.

48
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:12,250

49
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,460
So we get f prime of
c time b minus a.

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,740
Now, we just want to show,
again, that f of b minus f of

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,530
a cannot be 0.

52
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,070
What's the only thing-- well,
not only thing, we know two

53
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,570
things-- what two things
do we know?

54
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,350
We know f prime of c is not 0.

55
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,380
That was given to you.

56
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,360
f prime is never 0, so certainly
at any fixed value,

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
f prime of c is not 0.

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,860
So we know this term is not 0.

59
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,530
We also know that b is not equal
to a, so we know b minus

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,160
a is not 0.

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,580
The only way to get a product
of two numbers to be 0 is if

62
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,380
one of them is 0.

63
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,080
So this in fact, this product
is not equal to 0.

64
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,830
The fact that this product is
not equal to 0 tells us f of b

65
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,950
minus f of a is not
equal to 0.

66
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,970
And that alone is enough to
conclude that f of b is not

67
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,150
equal to f of a.

68
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,200
So, again, let me just point
out of this is probably

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,580
reminds you very much of the
type of thing you've seen

70
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,140
where you were showing if f
prime had a sign, then you

71
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,400
could determine whether f was
increasing or decreasing.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
It's the same type of
problem as that.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,180
It's exploiting what the mean
value theorem tells you.

74
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,080
So I think we'll stop there.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,335
