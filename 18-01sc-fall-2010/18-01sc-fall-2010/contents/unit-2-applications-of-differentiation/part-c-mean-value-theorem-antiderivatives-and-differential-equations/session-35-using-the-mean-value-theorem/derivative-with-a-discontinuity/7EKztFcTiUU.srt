00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,420
PROFESSOR: Hi.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,970
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,680
I have here a little bit of
a strange problem for you.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,640
So let me just tell it to
you, and then I'll give you

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
some time to work on it.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,010
So I want to define
a function, g of x,

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,390
and I want to
define it piecewise.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,020
So when x is positive, I just
want g of x to be 1 over x.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,320
But when x is negative, I want
g of x to be 1 of x plus 2.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,510
So I've got a little graph
here of the function.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,610
So you've got, you know,
when x is positive,

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,800
it's just your usual
y equals 1 over x.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,969
But when x is negative, I've
taken, I've shifted it up by 2.

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,510
So this is a perfectly
good function.

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,627
It's not defined at 0.

16
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,130
OK?

17
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,840
So what I would
like you to do is

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,010
to compute the derivative
of this function, wherever

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,550
it's defined.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,331
And you'll notice, when you get
there, that you'll have some..

21
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:58,440
you'll get some answer, and
maybe you'll notice something

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,730
a little weird
about that answer.

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,670
So if you notice something weird
about it, what I want you to do

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,434
is try and explain
why this is true.

25
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,100
And if you don't
notice something weird,

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,000
then, you know, come back and
we'll talk about it together.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,350
So why don't you pause the
video, go do that computation,

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,400
and think about what, if there's
something strange going on

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,245
here.

30
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,453
And then come back and we
can talk about it together.

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,180
Welcome back.

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,284
Hopefully you had some fun
working on this problem

33
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:32,200
and thinking about it.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,100
So let's do the
first part, which

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,020
is just the computational part.

36
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,002
Let's have a go at it.

37
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:40,960
So, because this function
is defined piecewise,

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,630
when we compute a derivative, we
can just compute the derivative

39
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,630
on the different pieces.

40
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,860
So the function
isn't defined at 0,

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,260
so of course, it doesn't
have a derivative at 0.

42
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,990
But then we can compute a
derivative when x is positive,

43
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,580
and we can compute a
derivative when x is negative.

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,020
So when x is bigger than
0, g prime of x, well,

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,020
that's just d over
dx of 1 over x.

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,730
So that's something
we're familiar with.

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,355
Its minus 1 over x squared.

48
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:15,875
So that's for x positive.

49
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:28,530
When x is less than 0, g
prime of x is d over dx of 1

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,760
over x plus 2, because
that's what g of x is.

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,360
And, OK, and so this is,
well, the plus 2 gets killed,

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,910
and so then we have the
derivative of 1 over x.

53
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,350
That's minus 1 over x squared.

54
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,704
So one thing you've noticed
is that this is minus 1

55
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,120
over x squared here, and it's
minus 1 over x squared here.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,620
So although we defined
this piecewise,

57
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,900
we could, we can
summarize this by saying,

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,360
so the derivative is minus
1 over x squared always,

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,639
so for all x not
equal to-- you know,

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,430
it doesn't have a
derivative at x equals 0.

61
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,360
It's not defined at 0, it
can't have a derivative there.

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,720
So, but we don't need the
piecewise definition, anymore.

63
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,660
So that was kind of
interesting, that we

64
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,100
can summarize the derivative
of this piecewise function

65
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,685
in a non-piecewise way.

66
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,810
Now, the thing is, we've
learned what the anti-derivative

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,240
of this function is.

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:40,820
So we know that the
anti-derivative of minus 1

69
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:48,290
over x squared dx is 1
over x plus a constant.

70
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,710
So we know that the functions
whose derivative is minus 1

71
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,740
over x squared are of the
form, 1 over x plus a constant.

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,480
The thing is, this function
g that we just talked about,

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,125
this function g
isn't of that form.

74
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,020
Right?

75
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,370
You don't get this function
by taking the function

76
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,010
1 over x and just
shifting it up or down.

77
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,825
You-- something weird happens.

78
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,350
You've shifted it
up on one piece

79
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,970
and not on the other piece.

80
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,815
And yet, it's still true
that the derivative of g

81
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,170
is equal to minus
1 over x squared.

82
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,749
So this is a little bit
of a head-scratcher.

83
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:25,264
And I wanted to talk
about why this happens.

84
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,680
And the thing is that there's
a sort of theoretical reason

85
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,510
for this, which is
that you remember

86
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,900
that the reason that we know
that anti-derivatives have

87
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,130
this form, a function
plus a constant,

88
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,280
is because we know
that constants

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,640
are the functions
with derivative 0.

90
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,860
And so we were able to apply
the mean value theorem in order

91
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,540
to show that if two functions
have the same derivative, then

92
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,480
they differ by each other,
differ from each other

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,500
by a constant.

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,560
If two functions have
the same derivative,

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,870
they differ by a constant.

96
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,870
And we used, as a really
crucial step in that proof,

97
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,744
the mean value theorem.

98
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:05,410
Now the thing is, the
mean value theorem

99
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,090
has, as one of its assumptions,
as one of its hypotheses,

100
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,940
that the functions that
you're working with

101
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,669
are continuous
and differentiable

102
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:13,377
in some interval.

103
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,620
OK?

104
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,830
So what's happened here is
that the functions that we're

105
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,260
talking about, the function 1
over x and the function minus 1

106
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,570
over x squared,
those functions are

107
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,985
continuous and differentiable
on certain intervals.

108
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,860
So if we look-- if we
go back to this picture

109
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,370
here we see that this function
g of x, just like the function 1

110
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,570
over x, it's continuous and
differentiable for positive x,

111
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,040
it's continuous and
differentiable for negative x,

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,960
but at 0, there's
a discontinuity.

113
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,890
So there's no
interval that crosses

114
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,260
0 on which this function is
continuous or differentiable.

115
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,610
As a result, the
mean value theorem

116
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,080
can't tell us anything about
intervals that cross 0.

117
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,010
So if the mean value
theorem doesn't tell us

118
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,300
anything in that case, it
means the conclusion isn't true

119
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,710
and we get a situation-- sorry.

120
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,070
I should rephrase that.

121
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,120
It means the conclusion
doesn't have to be true.

122
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,150
Our proof doesn't work in a case
where we have a discontinuity.

123
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,270
And what happens,
in fact, is right

124
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,850
what we have here, which is that
when you have a function that

125
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,000
has a discontinuity and you look
at its anti-derivatives, what

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,410
you can do is that, in addition
to shifting the whole thing up

127
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,300
and down, you can
shift the pieces

128
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,660
on either side of the
discontinuity separately.

129
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,870
Just like in this case
we can shift the piece

130
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,560
to the left of 0 separately
from the piece to the right of 0

131
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,580
and get a function whose
derivative is still

132
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,690
what we started with.

133
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,650
So this function g of x, we
get by shifting part of 1

134
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,730
over x up, and it gives us a
function whose derivative is

135
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,020
still minus 1 over x squared.

136
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,860
So this is true anytime
you have a function

137
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,735
with a discontinuity.

138
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:59,930
So one consequence of this--
I'm going to go back over here

139
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:08,260
and just write down one special
case of this-- is that to say,

140
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,710
we say that the
anti-derivative of 1 over x dx

141
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,010
is equal to ln of the
absolute value of x plus c.

142
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,900
What this really means is
that when x is positive,

143
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,360
we have a single kind
of anti-derivative,

144
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,470
and they're of the form,
ln x plus a constant.

145
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,220
And when x is negative, we
have a single anti-derivative,

146
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,800
that's-- or single family
of anti-derivatives,

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
of the form ln of
minus x-- remember,

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,740
absolutely value of x is minus
x when x is negative-- plus c.

149
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,880
But if we consider x to
be positive and negative

150
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,140
at the same time,
the two constants

151
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,494
don't necessarily have to agree.

152
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:50,160
You can have the same
situation that you

153
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,760
had before where one side can
shift up and down independently

154
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,490
of the other, because there's
that discontinuity at 0 there.

155
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,710
So this is just something
to keep in mind.

156
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,390
It also means you
have to be careful

157
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,820
with certain substitutions.

158
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,500
You don't want to
do substitutions

159
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,290
that have discontinuities.

160
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,630
If you do substitutions
that have discontinuities,

161
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,150
you might accidentally
introduce a discontinuity

162
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,020
and bad things can happen
that I won't go into now.

163
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,490
You can make-- end
up with statements

164
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,310
that don't make any sense by
making a substitution where

165
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,130
the function that
you're substituting

166
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,769
has a discontinuity in it.

167
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:27,560
So you-- or another
way of saying it is you

168
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,430
have to restrict to some
interval on which it really

169
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,630
is continuous.

170
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,890
And then on each of those
intervals it makes sense,

171
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,620
but bad things could
happen when you

172
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,850
cross those discontinuities.

173
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,620
So this is a little
bit theoretical,

174
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,650
but I think it's a nice
thing to be aware of,

175
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,110
a nice thing to keep in
mind when you're working

176
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,460
with some of these expressions.

177
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,964
So I'll end there.
