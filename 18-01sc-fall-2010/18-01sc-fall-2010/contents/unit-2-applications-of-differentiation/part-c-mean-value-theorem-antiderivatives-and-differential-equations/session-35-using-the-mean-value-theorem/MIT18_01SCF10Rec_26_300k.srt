00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,660
CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
to recitation.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,500
Today what I'd like us to do
is look at the inequality

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,630
tangent x bigger than x for
the x values between

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,570
0 and pi over 2.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,850
We want to show that that is
definitely true using the mean

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,960
value theorem.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,080
And I want to point out that
this was actually something

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,760
that Joel used when he was
a graphing tangent x and

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,580
arctangent x on the
same x, y plane.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,220
He used this fact in order to
get the right-looking graph.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,680
So what I'd like you to do,
again, is I want you to show

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,690
that for any x between 0 and
pi over 2, tangent x

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,880
is bigger than x.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,620
And use the mean value
theorem to do it.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,980
I'll give you a little time to
think about it, to work on it,

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,580
and then I'll be back and
we'll do it together.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:56,330

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,580
OK.

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,790
Welcome back.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,070
So I'm going to take us through

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,400
how to do this problem.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,760
And what I want to do is
I want to point out

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,900
a few things initially.

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,630
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to remind us of the form

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,590
of the mean value theorem
that we need.

27
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:16,060
And the form that we need will
be f of x is equal to f of a

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,610
plus f prime of c
times x minus a.

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,420
And here, remember, c has
to be between a and x.

30
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,230
So in this case, what we want to
consider is the region from

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,360
0 up to some x value.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,490
So always, this is, if you think
about it, the a and the

33
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,420
x, well, a will be 0 and x will
be the right hand region,

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,280
always less than pi over 2.

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,790
So what we need to check is, I'm
going to consider f of x

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,730
equal tangent x.

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,870
And what I need to consider is,
does tangent x satisfy the

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,910
hypotheses of the mean
value theorem on

39
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,230
the region of interest?

40
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,600
And so our region of interest
will always be a equals 0 and

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,390
b is equals to x, which is
less than some pi over 2.

42
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,270
And it is true, tangent x is
continuous between 0 and any

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,860
value less than pi over 2.

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,910
And it's also differentiable
between 0 and any value less

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,910
than pi over 2.

46
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,670
So I can apply the mean value
theorem to tangent x.

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,010
So in order to do this now, what
I'd like to see is what

48
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,650
kind of things I need
for the right hand

49
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,520
side of this equation.

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,260
So I obviously need to know what
the output is at a, which

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,795
is equal to 0.

52
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:38,990
So let's recall f of 0.

53
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,870
Well, tangent 0 is 0-- it's
sine of 0 divided

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,500
by cosine of 0.

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
And then I need to evaluate
the derivative somewhere

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,120
between a, which is
0, and pi over 2.

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,760
x can be any value less
than pi over 2.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,940
So let's evaluate what the
derivative is in terms of x.

59
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,880
We did this, actually, in
another recitation.

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,890
The derivative of tangent
x is secant squared x.

61
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,970
And so now let's plug in what we
know and then see what else

62
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,785
we need to do in order to finish
solving this problem.

63
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:16,230

64
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,890
OK.

65
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,170
So what we have. f of x, I'm
actually going to write

66
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,380
tangent x, so we can see
what's happening here.

67
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,260
f of x is tangent x, and then I
have that that equals, well,

68
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,650
f of a is 0 plus f prime
evaluated at c--

69
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,495
so that's going to be
secant squared c--

70
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:40,580

71
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,090
times x minus a.

72
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,520
Well, a here is 0, so this
is just times x.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,480
So we're very close.

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,210
We're very close to showing
tangent x is

75
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,460
always bigger than x.

76
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,880

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,030
In fact, you can see
very easily what

78
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,440
ultimately we need to show.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,120
We just need to show that secant
squared c is bigger

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
than 1 in our region of
interest. And that would do

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,810
it, because then this would
be bigger than 1 times x.

82
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,651
The right hand side would be
bigger than 1 times x, so that

83
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,170
would be sufficient

84
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,610
So let's make sure we understand
what secant squared

85
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,180
c can look like.

86
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,530
Or what the values can be.

87
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,060
So we have c is between
0 and x, which is less

88
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,685
than pi over 2.

89
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,430
Right?

90
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,350
That's where c is.

91
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,560
So we always need to remember
what values c could possibly

92
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,910
have.

93
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,270
And then let's think about
what we know about

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,650
secant of c, there.

95
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,400
Well, secant of c is equal
to 1 over cosine of c.

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,110
So if you can't remember what
secant's values are, think

97
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,680
about the values of cosine
in that region.

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,490
So I'm going to draw a rough
sketch of the value of cosine

99
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,050
between 0 and pi over 2.

100
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,179

101
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:56,250
The value of cosine does
something like this.

102
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,040
This is 0, this is pi over 2.

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,070
This is a very rough sketch.

104
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,310
But this output is 1.

105
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,820
So between 0 and pi over
2, cosine of c is

106
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,880
always less than 1.

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,515
So 1 over cosine of c is
always bigger than 1.

108
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,270
OK?

109
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,120
Because we're taking that
reciprocal value.

110
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,660
So again, cosine of c from 0
to pi over 2, not including

111
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,920
0's, always strictly
less than 1.

112
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,100
And so 1 over cosine c
is always strictly

113
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,440
greater than 1.

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,720
And so now I have the
information I need to come

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,260
back and finish the problem.

116
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,030
So again, we were looking at
the expression, we have

117
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,930
tangent x is equal to secant
squared c times x.

118
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,380
Well, now I know secant c is
bigger than 1, so now I know

119
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,680
this whole thing is bigger than
1 times x, which is just

120
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,220
equal to x.

121
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,720
So if you noticed, on the left
hand side we have a tangent x

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,860
equals something which
is bigger than x.

123
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,650
So we've just shown that, for
any value of x between 0 and

124
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,290
pi over 2, tangent x
is bigger than x.

125
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,230
And I think we'll stop there.

126
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,432
