CHRISTINE BREINER:
Welcome to recitation.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,840
Today what I'd like us to do is
look at the inequality tangent

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,570
x bigger than x for the x-values
between 0 and pi over 2.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,160
We want to show that
that is definitely true

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,747
using the mean value theorem.

6
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:24,080
And I want to point out that
this was actually something

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,560
that Joel used when he
was a graphing tangent x

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,580
and arctangent x on
the same xy-plane.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,220
He used this fact in order to
get the right-looking graph.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,740
So what I'd like
you to do, again,

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,130
is I want you to show that for
any x between 0 and pi over 2,

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,880
tangent x is bigger than x.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,620
And use the mean value
theorem to do it.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,980
I'll give you a little time to
think about it, to work on it,

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,938
and then I'll be back
and we'll do it together.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,580
OK.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,790
Welcome back.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,400
So I'm going to take us
through how to do this problem.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,760
And what I want to do
is I want to point out

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,810
a few things initially.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,310
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,600
to remind us of the form
of the mean value theorem

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,590
that we need.

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,490
And the form that
we need will be

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:20,610
f of x is equal to f of a plus
f prime of c times x minus a.

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,420
And here, remember, c has
to be between a and x.

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,700
So in this case, what we want
to consider is the region from 0

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,360
up to some x-value.

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,680
So always, this is, if you
think about it, the a and the x,

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,810
well, a will be 0 and x will be
the right-hand region, always

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,280
less than pi over 2.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,980
So what we need to
check is, I'm going

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,730
to consider f of
x equal tangent x.

34
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,070
And what I need to
consider is, does tangent x

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,780
satisfy the hypotheses
of the mean value theorem

36
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,230
on the region of interest?

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,430
And so our region of interest
will always be a equals 0

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,390
and b is equal to x, which
is less than some pi over 2.

39
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,990
And it is true, tangent
x is continuous between 0

40
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,860
and any value less
than pi over 2.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,990
And it's also
differentiable between 0

42
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,910
and any value less
than pi over 2.

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,670
So I can apply the mean
value theorem to tangent x.

44
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,680
So in order to do this
now, what I'd like to see

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,430
is what kind of things I
need for the right-hand side

46
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,520
of this equation.

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,530
So I obviously need to
know what the output is

48
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,795
at a, which is equal to 0.

49
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:38,990
So let's recall f of 0.

50
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,500
Well, tangent 0 is 0-- it's sine
of 0 divided by cosine of 0.

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,830
And then I need to evaluate the
derivative somewhere between a,

52
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,120
which is 0, and pi over 2.

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,760
x can be any value
less than pi over 2.

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,940
So let's evaluate what the
derivative is in terms of x.

55
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,880
We did this, actually,
in another recitation.

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,890
The derivative of tangent
x is secant squared x.

57
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,020
And so now let's
plug in what we know

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,494
and then see what else
we need to do in order

59
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,785
to finish solving this problem.

60
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,890
OK.

61
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,710
So what we have.

62
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,820
f of x, I'm actually
going to write tangent x,

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,380
so we can see what's
happening here.

64
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,910
f of x is tangent x, and
then I have that that equals,

65
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,650
well, f of a is 0, plus
f prime evaluated at c--

66
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,090
so that's going to be secant
squared c-- times x minus a.

67
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,520
Well, a here is 0, so
this is just times x.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,322
So we're very close.

69
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:49,780
We're very close
to showing tangent

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,230
x is always bigger than x.

71
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,640
In fact, you can see very
easily what ultimately we

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
need to show.

73
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,590
We just need to show that secant
squared c is bigger than 1

74
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,720
in our region of interest.

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,345
And that would do
it, because then this

76
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:04,810
would be bigger than 1 times x.

77
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,670
The right-hand side

78
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,170
would be bigger than 1 times
x, so that would be sufficient.

79
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,940
So let's make sure
we understand what

80
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,180
secant squared c can look like.

81
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,530
Or what the values can be.

82
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,685
So we have c is between 0 and
x, which is less than pi over 2.

83
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,430
Right?

84
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,350
That's where c is.

85
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,090
So we always need
to remember what

86
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,910
values c could possibly have.

87
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,150
And then let's think about
what we know about secant of c,

88
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,650
there.

89
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,400
Well, secant of c is equal
to 1 over cosine of c.

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,910
So if you can't remember
what secant's values are,

91
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,680
think about the values
of cosine in that region.

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,490
So I'm going to draw a rough
sketch of the value of cosine

93
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,050
between 0 and pi over 2.

94
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:56,250
The value of cosine does
something like this.

95
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,040
This is 0, this is pi over 2.

96
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,070
This is a very rough sketch.

97
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,310
But this output is 1.

98
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,650
So between 0 and pi
over 2, cosine of c

99
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,880
is always less than 1.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,515
So 1 over cosine of c
is always bigger than 1.

101
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,270
OK?

102
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,120
Because we're taking
that reciprocal value.

103
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,010
So again, cosine of c from 0
to pi over 2, not including 0,

104
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,920
is always strictly less than 1.

105
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,440
And so 1 over cosine c is
always strictly greater than 1.

106
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,510
And so now I have
the information

107
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,987
I need to come back
and finish the problem.

108
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:32,820
So again, we were looking
at the expression,

109
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,930
we have tangent x is equal
to secant squared c times x.

110
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,690
Well, now I know secant
c is bigger than 1,

111
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,150
so now I know this whole
thing is bigger than 1 times

112
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,220
x, which is just equal to x.

113
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,080
So if you noticed,
on the left-hand side

114
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,850
we have a tangent
x equals something

115
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,860
which is bigger than x.

116
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,510
So we've just shown that,
for any value of x between 0

117
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,290
and pi over 2, tangent
x is bigger than x.

118
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,932
And I think we'll stop there.
