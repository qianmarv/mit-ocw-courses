8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,970
PROFESSOR: Today we're moving
on from theoretical things,

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,570
from the mean value theorem,
to the introduction to what's

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,120
going to occupy us for the
whole rest of the course, which

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,850
is integration.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,850
So, in order to
introduce that subject,

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,660
I need to introduce for
you a new notation, which

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:52,640
is called differentials.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm going to tell you
what a differential is,

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,040
and we'll get used to
using it over time.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:10,290
If you have a function
which is y = f(x),

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:27,650
then the differential of y
is going to be denoted dy,

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,500
and it's by definition f'(x) dx.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,410
So here's the notation.

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,800
And because y is really
equal to f, sometimes

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,140
we also call it the
differential of f.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:58,700
It's also called the
differential of f.

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:06,750
That's the notation,
and it's the same thing

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,630
as what happens if you
formally just take this dx,

26
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,910
act like it's a number
and divide it into dy.

27
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,670
So it means the same thing
as this statement here.

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,160
And this is more or less
the Leibniz interpretation

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:38,360
of derivatives.

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:50,990
Of a derivative as a ratio of
these so called differentials.

31
00:02:50,990 --> 00:03:04,290
It's a ratio of what are
known as infinitesimals.

32
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,050
Now, this is kind of a vague
notion, this little bit

33
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,830
here being an infinitesimal.

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,110
It's sort of like an
infinitely small quantity.

35
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,300
And Leibniz perfected
the idea of dealing

36
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,050
with these intuitively.

37
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,730
And subsequently, mathematicians
use them all the time.

38
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,350
They're way more effective than
the notation that Newton used.

39
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,250
You might think that
notations are a small matter,

40
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,960
but they allow you to think
much faster, sometimes.

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,565
When you have the right
names and the right symbols

42
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:44,190
for everything.

43
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,860
And in this case it made
it very big difference.

44
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,850
Leibniz's notation was adopted
on the continent and Newton

45
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,650
dominated in Britain
and, as a result,

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,800
the British fell
behind by one or two

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,850
hundred years in the
development of calculus.

48
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,540
It was really a serious matter.

49
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,860
So it's really well
worth your while to get

50
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,940
used to this idea of ratios.

51
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,140
And it comes up all over the
place, both in this class

52
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,320
and also in
multivariable calculus.

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,380
It's used in many contexts.

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,030
So first of all, just
to go a little bit easy.

55
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,320
We'll illustrate it by its
use in linear approximations,

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:36,420
which we've already done.

57
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,780
The picture here, which we've
drawn a number of times,

58
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,020
is that you have some function.

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,300
And here's a value
of the function.

60
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,060
And it's coming up like that.

61
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,330
So here's our function.

62
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,090
And we go forward
a little increment

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,540
to a place which is
dx further along.

64
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,350
The idea of this
notation is that dx

65
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,260
is going to replace
the symbol delta x,

66
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,370
which is the change in x.

67
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,270
And we won't think
too hard about-- well,

68
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,560
this is a small quantity,
this is a small quantity,

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,030
we're not going to think too
hard about what that means.

70
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,780
Now, similarly, if you see
how much we've gone up - well,

71
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,600
this is kind of low, so
it's a small bit here.

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,240
So this distance
here is, previously

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,040
we called it delta y.

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,810
But now we're just
going to call it dy.

75
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:51,200
So dy replaces delta y.

76
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,450
So this is the change in
level of the function.

77
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,760
And we'll represent it
symbolically this way.

78
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,050
Very frequently, this just
saves a little bit of notation.

79
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,930
For the purposes
of this, we'll be

80
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,620
doing the same things we did
with delta x and delta y,

81
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,540
but this is the way that
Leibniz thought of it.

82
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,690
And he would just have
drawn it with this.

83
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:24,670
So this distance here is dx
and this distance here is dy.

84
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,320
So for an example of
linear approximation,

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,970
we'll say what's 64.1,
say, to the 1/3 power,

86
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,500
approximately equal to?

87
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,470
Now, I'm going to carry this
out in this new notation here.

88
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,810
The function involved is x^1/3.

89
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,990
And then it's a
differential, dy.

90
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,670
Now, I want to use this
rule to get used to it.

91
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,870
Because this is what we're going
to be doing all of today is,

92
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,010
we're differentiating, or
taking the differential of y.

93
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,490
So that is going to be
just the derivative.

94
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:11,980
That's 1/3 x^(-2/3) dx.

95
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,060
And now I'm just going to
fill in exactly what this is.

96
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,450
At x = 64, which is the natural
place close by where it's easy

97
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:36,110
to do the evaluations, we have
y = 64^(1/3), which is just 4.

98
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,740
And how about dy?

99
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,360
Well, so this is a little
bit more complicated.

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,540
Put it over here.

101
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:50,690
So dy = 1/3 64^(-2/3) dx.

102
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:16,680
And that is 1/3 * 1/16
dx, which is 1/48 dx.

103
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,810
And now I'm going
to work out what

104
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,320
64 to the, whatever it is
here, this strange fraction.

105
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,210
I just want to be very careful
to explain to you one more

106
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,170
thing.

107
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,780
Which is that
we're using x = 64,

108
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:45,240
and so we're thinking of x
+ dx is going to be 64.1.

109
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:53,700
So that means that dx
is going to be 1/10.

110
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,760
So that's the increment
that we're interested in.

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,910
And now I can carry
out the approximation.

112
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:11,230
The approximation says
that 64.1^(1/3) is, well,

113
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,710
it's approximately what
I'm going to call y + dy.

114
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,060
Because really, the dy
that I'm determining here

115
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:26,450
is determined by this linear
relation. dy = 1/48 dx.

116
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,820
And so this is only
approximately true.

117
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,430
Because what's really
true is that this

118
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,690
is equal to y + delta y.

119
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,590
In our previous notation.

120
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,600
So this is in disguise.

121
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
What this is equal to.

122
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,500
And that's the
only approximately

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,470
equal to what the linear
approximation would give you.

124
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,730
So, really, even though I wrote
dy is this increment here,

125
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,830
what it really is if
dx is exactly that,

126
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,410
is it's the amount
it would go up

127
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,270
if you went straight
up the tangent line.

128
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,300
So I'm not going to do
that because that's not

129
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,370
what people write.

130
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,040
And that's not even
what they think.

131
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,110
They're really thinking
of both dx and dy

132
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,750
as being infinitesimally small.

133
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,900
And here we're going to the
finite level and doing it.

134
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,350
So this is just something
you have to live with,

135
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:28,120
is a little ambiguity
in this notation.

136
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,490
This is the approximation.

137
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,970
And now I can just calculate
these numbers here.

138
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,130
y at this value is 4.

139
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:43,630
And dy, as I said, is 1/48 dx.

140
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:50,440
And that turns out to be 4
+ 1/480, because dx is 1/10.

141
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,390
So that's approximately 4.002.

142
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:04,550
And that's our approximation.

143
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:20,760
Now, let's just compare it
to our previous notation.

144
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,970
This will serve as
a review of, if you

145
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:35,870
like, of linear approximation.

146
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,990
But what I want to emphasize
is that these things

147
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,210
are supposed to be the same.

148
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,520
Just that it's really
the same thing.

149
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,280
It's just a different
notation for the same thing.

150
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,360
I remind you the basic formula
for linear approximation is

151
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,980
that f(x) is approximately
f(a) + f'(a) (x-a).

152
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,620
And we're applying it in the
situation that a = 64 and f(x)

153
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,910
= x^(1/3).

154
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:27,580
And so f(a), which is
f(64), is of course 4.

155
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:43,210
And f'(a), which is 1/3
a^(-2/3), is in our case 1/16.

156
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,600
No, 1/48.

157
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,980
OK, that's the same
calculation as before.

158
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,490
And then our relationship
becomes x^(1/3) is

159
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:08,420
approximately equal to 4 plus
1/48 times x minus a, which is

160
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,250
64.

161
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,820
So look, every single number
that I've written over here

162
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,030
has a corresponding number
for this other method.

163
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,250
And now if I plug in the
value we happen to want,

164
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:32,500
which is the 64.1, this
would be 4 + 1/48 1/10,

165
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,580
which is just the same
thing we had before.

166
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,270
So again, same answer.

167
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:55,300
Same method, new notation.

168
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Well, now I get to use this
notation in a novel way.

169
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,640
So again, here's the notation.

170
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:16,410
This notation of differential.

171
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,520
The way I'm going to use it
is in discussing something

172
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:32,560
called antiderivative Again,
this is a new notation now.

173
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,680
But it's also a new idea.

174
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,850
It's one that we
haven't discussed yet.

175
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,500
Namely, the notation that
I want to describe here

176
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,090
is what's called the
integral of g(x) dx.

177
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,560
And I'll denote that by a
function capital G of x.

178
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,820
So it's, you start
with a function g(x)

179
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,380
and you produce a
function capital

180
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:12,190
G(x), which is called
the antiderivative of g.

181
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,330
Notice there's a
differential sitting in here.

182
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:31,380
This symbol, this guy here,
is called an integral sign.

183
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,600
Or an integral, or this whole
thing is called an integral.

184
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,830
And another name for
the antiderivative of g

185
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:50,700
is the indefinite integral of g.

186
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:58,050
And I'll explain to you why
it's indefinite in just--

187
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,330
very shortly here.

188
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:13,330
Well, so let's carry
out some examples.

189
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,840
Basically what I'd like
to do is as many examples

190
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,510
along the lines of
all the derivatives

191
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,329
that we derived at the
beginning of the course.

192
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:22,870
In other words, in
principle you want

193
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,550
to be able to integrate as
many things as possible.

194
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:34,680
We're going to start out with
the integral of sin x dx.

195
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,670
That's a function whose
derivative is sin x.

196
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,990
So what function would that be?

197
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,400
Cosine x, minus, right.

198
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,590
It's -cos x.

199
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,240
So -cos x differentiated
gives you sin x.

200
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,540
So that is an
antiderivative of sine.

201
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,210
And it satisfies this property.

202
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:09,520
So this function,
G(x) = - cos x,

203
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,170
has the property that
its derivative is sin x.

204
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:20,700
On the other hand, if you
differentiate a constant,

205
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,230
you get 0.

206
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,090
So this answer is what's
called indefinite.

207
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,910
Because you can also
add any constant here.

208
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,610
And the same thing will be true.

209
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,060
So, c is constant.

210
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,660
And as I said, the integral
is called indefinite.

211
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,410
So that's an explanation
for this modifier

212
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,810
in front of the "integral".

213
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,960
It's indefinite because
we actually didn't

214
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,540
specify a single function.

215
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,170
We don't get a single answer.

216
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,400
Whenever you take the
antiderivative of something

217
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:08,110
it's ambiguous up to a constant.

218
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,340
Next, let's do some
other standard functions

219
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,890
from our repertoire.

220
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,820
We have the integral of x^a dx.

221
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,730
Some power, the
integral of a power.

222
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,680
And if you think about it, what
you should be differentiating

223
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,590
is one power larger than that.

224
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:33,250
But then you have to
divide by 1/(a+1),

225
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,780
in order that the
differentiation be correct.

226
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:44,360
So this just is the fact
that d/dx of x^(a+1),

227
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,600
or maybe I should
even say it this way.

228
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,620
Maybe I'll do it in
differential notation.

229
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,230
d(x^(a+1)) = (a+1) x^a dx.

230
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,950
So if I divide that
through by a+1,

231
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,280
then I get the relation above.

232
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,800
And because this is
ambiguous up to a constant,

233
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,820
it could be any
additional constant

234
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,830
added to that function.

235
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,290
Now, the identity that I
wrote down below is correct.

236
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,700
But this one is
not always correct.

237
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,200
What's the exception?

238
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,211
Yeah. a equals--

239
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:38,710
STUDENT: 0.

240
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,060
PROFESSOR: Negative 1.

241
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,440
So this one is OK for all a.

242
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,550
But this one fails because
we've divided by 0 when a = -1.

243
00:19:52,550 --> 00:20:04,770
So this is only true when
a is not equal to -1.

244
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,790
And in fact, of course,
what's happening when a = 0,

245
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,670
you're getting 0 when you
differentiate the constant.

246
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,510
So there's a third case
that we have to carry out.

247
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:25,230
Which is the exceptional case,
namely the integral of dx/x.

248
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:31,265
And this time, if
we just think back

249
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,640
to what our-- So
what we're doing

250
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,080
is thinking backwards here,
which a very important thing

251
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,690
to do in math at all stages.

252
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,800
We got all of our formulas, now
we're reading them backwards.

253
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:49,890
And so this one, you
may remember, is ln x.

254
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,370
The reason why I want to do
this carefully and slowly now,

255
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,299
is right now I also want to
write the more standard form

256
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,090
which is presented.

257
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,540
So first of all, first we
have to add a constant.

258
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,160
And please don't put
the parentheses here.

259
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,360
The parentheses go there.

260
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,700
But there's another formula
hiding in the woodwork

261
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
here behind this one.

262
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,260
Which is that you can also
get the correct formula

263
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,870
when x is negative.

264
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:27,130
And that turns out
to be this one here.

265
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,670
So I'm treating the case, x
positive, as being something

266
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,460
that you know.

267
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:43,530
But let's check the
case, x negative.

268
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,810
In order to check
the case x negative,

269
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,750
I have to differentiate the
logarithm of the absolute value

270
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,680
of x in that case.

271
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,612
And that's the
same thing, again,

272
00:21:57,612 --> 00:22:02,170
for x negative as the derivative
of the logarithm of negative x.

273
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,410
That's the formula,
when x is negative.

274
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,980
And if you carry
that out, what you

275
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:18,400
get, maybe I'll put
this over here, is,

276
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
well, it's the chain rule.

277
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,160
It's 1/(-x) times the derivative
with respect to x of -x.

278
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,730
So see that there
are two minus signs.

279
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,750
There's a -x in the
denominator and then

280
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,610
there's the derivative
of -x in the numerator.

281
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,070
That's just -1.

282
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,160
This part is -1.

283
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,100
So this -1 over
-x, which is 1/x.

284
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:53,200
So the negative signs cancel.

285
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,090
If you just keep track of this
in terms of ln(-x) and its

286
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,480
graph, that's a function
that looks like this.

287
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,370
For x negative.

288
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:14,170
And its derivative
is 1/x, I claim.

289
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,120
And if you just look at
it a little bit carefully,

290
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,431
you see that the slope
is always negative.

291
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:23,930
Right?

292
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,950
So here the slope is negative.

293
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,480
So it's going to
be below the axis.

294
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,890
And, in fact, it's getting
steeper and steeper negative

295
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,980
as we go down.

296
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,980
And it's getting less and less
negative as we go horizontally.

297
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,790
So it's going like
this, which is indeed

298
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,770
the graph of this
function, for x negative.

299
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:53,320
Again, x negative.

300
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,850
So that's one other
standard formula.

301
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,501
And very quickly, very often,
we won't put the absolute value

302
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:01,000
signs.

303
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,180
We'll only consider the
case x positive here.

304
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,280
But I just want you to
have the tools to do it

305
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,710
in case we want to
use, we want to handle,

306
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:14,040
both positive and negative x.

307
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:28,620
Now, let's do two more examples.

308
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:35,870
The integral of sec^2 x dx.

309
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,270
These are supposed to
get you to remember

310
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,130
all of your differentiation
formulas, the standard ones.

311
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:48,200
So this one, integral of
sec^2 dx is what? tan x.

312
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,690
And here we have + c, all right?

313
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,520
And then the last one of, a
couple of, this type would be,

314
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
let's see.

315
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:04,139
I should do at least this one
here, square root of 1 - x^2.

316
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,680
This is another
notation, by the way,

317
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,240
which is perfectly acceptable.

318
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,280
Notice I've put the
dx in the numerator

319
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,400
and the function in
the denominator here.

320
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,880
So this one turns
out to be sin^(-1) x.

321
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,710
And, finally, let's see.

322
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,470
About the integral
of dx / (1 + x^2).

323
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:41,320
That one is tan^(-1) x.

324
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,652
For a little while, because
you're reading these things

325
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,110
backwards and
forwards, you'll find

326
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,970
this happens to you on exams.

327
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,540
It gets slightly worse
for a little while.

328
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,120
You will antidifferentiate when
you meant to differentiate.

329
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,620
And you'll differentiate
when you're

330
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,230
meant to antidifferentiate.

331
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,190
Don't get too
frustrated by that.

332
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,270
But eventually, you'll
get them squared away.

333
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,130
And it actually helps
to do a lot of practice

334
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:15,410
with antidifferentiations,
or integrations,

335
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,100
as they're sometimes called.

336
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,790
Because that will
solidify your remembering

337
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:25,820
all of the
differentiation formulas.

338
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,080
So, last bit of
information that I

339
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,730
want to emphasize before
we go on some more

340
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:44,130
complicated examples is this.

341
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,250
It's obvious because the
derivative of a constant is 0.

342
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,330
That the antiderivative is
ambiguous up to a constant.

343
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,920
But it's very
important to realize

344
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,410
that this is the only
ambiguity that there is.

345
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,390
So the last thing that
I want to tell you about

346
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:24,070
is uniqueness of antiderivatives
up to a constant.

347
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,290
The theorem is the following.

348
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:41,230
The theorem is if F' =
G', then F equals G--

349
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,620
so F(x) equals G(x)
plus a constant.

350
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:54,050
But that means, not only that
these are antiderivatives,

351
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,640
all these things with these
plus c's are antiderivatives.

352
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,080
But these are the only ones.

353
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,300
Which is very reassuring.

354
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,020
And that's a kind of uniqueness,
although its uniqueness up

355
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,660
to a constant, it's
acceptable to us.

356
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,850
Now, the proof of
this is very quick.

357
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,216
But this is a fundamental fact.

358
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:19,340
The proof is the following.

359
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:29,340
If F' = G', then if you take
the difference between the two

360
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,520
functions, its derivative,
which of course is F' -

361
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,110
G', is equal to 0.

362
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:55,300
Hence, F(x) - G(x)
is a constant.

363
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,940
Now, this is a key fact.

364
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,870
Very important fact.

365
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,840
We deduced it last time
from the mean value theorem.

366
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,370
It's not a small matter.

367
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,850
It's a very, very
important thing.

368
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,690
It's the basis for calculus.

369
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,550
It's the reason why
calculus make sense.

370
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,120
If we didn't have the fact
that the derivative is

371
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,890
0 implied that the function
was constant, we would be done.

372
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,012
We would have-- Calculus
would be just useless for us.

373
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,470
The point is, the
rate of change is

374
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,330
supposed to determine
the function up

375
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,650
to this starting value.

376
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,330
So this conclusion
is very important.

377
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,010
And we already checked it
last time, this conclusion.

378
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,710
And now just by
algebra, I can rearrange

379
00:29:37,710 --> 00:30:03,340
this to say that F(x) is
equal to G(x) plus a constant.

380
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,530
Now, maybe I should leave
differentials up here.

381
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:21,390
Because I want to
illustrate-- So let's

382
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:29,050
go on to some trickier,
slightly trickier, integrals.

383
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:35,740
Here's an example.

384
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,010
The integral of, say,
x^3 (x^4 + 2)^5 dx.

385
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,480
This is a function
which you actually

386
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,500
do know how to integrate,
because we already

387
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,840
have a formula for all powers.

388
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,280
Namely, the integral of
x^a is equal to this.

389
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,520
And even if it were a negative
power, we could do it.

390
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,630
So it's OK.

391
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:14,290
On the other hand, to expand the
5th power here is quite a mess.

392
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,480
And this is just a
very, very bad idea.

393
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,320
There's another trick for
doing this that evaluates this

394
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,060
much more efficiently.

395
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,950
And it's the only
device that we're going

396
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,550
to learn now for integrating.

397
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:36,690
Integration actually is much
harder than differentiation,

398
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,520
symbolically.

399
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,610
It's quite difficult. And
occasionally impossible.

400
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,550
And so we have to
go about it gently.

401
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,450
But for the purposes
of this unit,

402
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,069
we're only going
to use one method.

403
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:50,860
Which is very good.

404
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,526
That means whenever
you see an integral,

405
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:56,180
either you'll be able to divine
immediately what the answer is,

406
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,830
or you'll use this method.

407
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,090
So this is it.

408
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:09,470
The trick is called the
method of substitution.

409
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:17,860
And it is tailor-made for
notion of differentials.

410
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:36,510
So tailor-made for
differential notation.

411
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,840
The idea is the following.

412
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,260
I'm going to to
define a new function.

413
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,200
And it's the messiest
function that I see here.

414
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,290
It's u = x^4 + 2.

415
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:56,300
And then, I'm going to take
its differential and what

416
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,840
I discover, if I
look at its formula,

417
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,570
and the rule for differentials,
which is right here.

418
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,070
Its formula is what?

419
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,180
4x^3 dx.

420
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,000
Now, lo and behold with
these two quantities,

421
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,940
I can substitute, I can
plug in to this integral.

422
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,760
And I will simplify
it considerably.

423
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,350
So how does that happen?

424
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:34,740
Well, this integral is the
same thing as, well, really

425
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,350
I should combine
it the other way.

426
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,420
So let me move this over.

427
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,340
So there are two pieces here.

428
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,440
And this one is u^5.

429
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:54,990
And this one is 1/4 du.

430
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:01,840
Now, that makes it the
integral of u^5 du / 4.

431
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,040
And that's relatively
easy to integrate.

432
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,460
That is just a power.

433
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,410
So let's see.

434
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,250
It's just 1/20 u to
the-- whoops, not 1/20.

435
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,480
The antiderivative
of u^5 is u^6.

436
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:25,480
With the 1/6, so
it's 1/24 u^6 + c.

437
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,050
Now, that's not the
answer to the question.

438
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,260
It's almost the answer
to the question.

439
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,287
Why isn't it the answer?

440
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,120
It isn't the answer
because now the answer's

441
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,480
expressed in terms of u.

442
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,750
Whereas the problem was posed
in terms of this variable x.

443
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,960
So we must change back
to our variable here.

444
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,990
And we do that just
by writing it in.

445
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:56,190
So it's 1/24 (x^4 + 2)^6 + c.

446
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,120
And this is the
end of the problem.

447
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,990
Yeah, question.

448
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:16,350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

449
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,330
PROFESSOR: The question is,
can you see it directly?

450
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,160
Yeah.

451
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,820
And we're going to talk about
that in just one second.

452
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:30,290
OK.

453
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,500
Now, I'm going to
do one more example

454
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:44,310
and illustrate this method.

455
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,405
Here's another example.

456
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:51,430
The integral of x dx over
the square root of 1 + x^2.

457
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:56,610
Now, here's another example.

458
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:03,475
Now, the method of substitution
leads us to the idea u = 1 +

459
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,190
x^2.

460
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:11,540
du = 2x dx, etc.

461
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,450
It takes about as long as
this other problem did.

462
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,720
To figure out what's going on.

463
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,440
It's a very similar
sort of thing.

464
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,870
You end up integrating u^(-1/2).

465
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,480
It leads to the
integral of u^(-1/2) du.

466
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,630
Is everybody seeing
where this...?

467
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:37,540
However, there is a
slightly better method.

468
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:46,070
So recommended method.

469
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:59,250
And I call this method
advanced guessing.

470
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,077
What advanced guessing
means is that you've

471
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:02,660
done enough of these
problems that you

472
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,750
can see two steps ahead.

473
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,030
And you know what's
going to happen.

474
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,440
So the advanced
guessing leads you

475
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,817
to believe that here
you had a power -1/2,

476
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,650
here you have the
differential of the thing.

477
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,790
So it's going to
work out somehow.

478
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,670
And the advanced guessing allows
you to guess that the answer

479
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,520
should be something like
this. (1 + x^2)^(1/2).

480
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,800
So this is your advanced guess.

481
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,670
And now you just differentiate
it, and see whether it works.

482
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,550
Well, here it is.

483
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:39,330
It's 1/2 (1 + x^2)^(-1/2) 2x,
that's the chain rule here.

484
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:44,770
Which, sure enough, gives you
x over square root of 1 + x^2.

485
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,480
So we're done.

486
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:56,960
And so the answer is square
root of (1 + x^2) + c.

487
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,160
Let me illustrate this
further with another example.

488
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,010
I strongly recommend
that you do this,

489
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,270
but you have to get used to it.

490
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,490
So here's another example.

491
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:18,900
e^(6x) dx.

492
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:26,360
My advanced guess is e^(6x).

493
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,020
And if I check, when
I differentiate it,

494
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,180
I get 6e^(6x).

495
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,020
That's the derivative.

496
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,030
And so I know that
the answer, so now I

497
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,030
know what the answer is.

498
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:46,300
It's 1/6 e^(6x) + c.

499
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:54,510
Now, OK, you could,
it's also OK, but slow,

500
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:02,550
to use a substitution,
to use u = 6x.

501
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,920
Then you're going to get
du = 6dx, dot, dot, dot.

502
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:23,220
It's going to work, it's
just a waste of time.

503
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,760
Well, I'm going to give
you a couple more examples.

504
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,910
So how about this one.

505
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,120
x e^(-x^2) dx.

506
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,600
What's the guess?

507
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,270
Anybody have a guess?

508
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,480
Well, you could also correct.

509
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,438
So I don't want you to
bother - yeah, go ahead.

510
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:56,787
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

511
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:59,120
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so you're
already one step ahead of me.

512
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,050
Because this is too easy.

513
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,110
When they get more
complicated, you just

514
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,690
want to make this guess here.

515
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,884
So various people have said
1/2, and they understand

516
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:10,050
that there's 1/2 going here.

517
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,890
But let me just show
you what happens, OK?

518
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:19,140
If you make this guess
and you differentiate it,

519
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,940
what you get here is
e^(-x^2) times the derivative

520
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,130
of negative 2x, so that's -2x.

521
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,400
x^2, so it's -2x.

522
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,970
So now you see that you're off
by a factor of not 2, but -2.

523
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,820
So a number of you
were saying that.

524
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,120
So the answer is
-1/2 e^(-x^2) + c.

525
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,090
And I can guarantee
you, having watched

526
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:55,290
this on various problems, that
people who don't write this out

527
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,360
make arithmetic mistakes.

528
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,140
In other words, there
is a limit to how much

529
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,760
people can think ahead
and guess correctly.

530
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Another way of doing
it, by the way,

531
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,680
is simply to write
this thing in and then

532
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,160
fix the coefficient by doing
the differentiation here.

533
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,850
That's perfectly OK as well.

534
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,920
All right, one more example.

535
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:30,840
We're going to integrate
sin x cos x dx.

536
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,750
So what's a good
guess for this one?

537
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

538
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,850
PROFESSOR: Someone
suggesting sin^2 x.

539
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,490
So let's try that.

540
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,020
Over 2 - well, we'll get the
coefficient in just a second.

541
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:50,970
So sin^2 x, if I differentiate,
I get 2 sin x cos x.

542
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,380
So that's off by a factor of 2.

543
00:41:53,380 --> 00:42:04,540
So the answer is 1/2 sin^2 x.

544
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:12,320
But now I want to
point out to you

545
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,120
that there's another way
of doing this problem.

546
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:31,240
It's also true that if
you differentiate cos^2 x,

547
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,600
you get 2 cos x (-sin x).

548
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:51,030
So another answer is that the
integral of sin x cos x dx is

549
00:42:51,030 --> 00:43:01,840
equal to -1/2 cos^2 x + c.

550
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,740
So what is going on here?

551
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,890
What's the problem with this?

552
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,785
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

553
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:11,660
PROFESSOR: Pardon me?

554
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

555
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,130
PROFESSOR: Integrals
aren't unique.

556
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,390
That's part of the-- but
somehow these two answers still

557
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,320
have to be the same.

558
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:32,910
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

559
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,910
PROFESSOR: OK.

560
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,660
What do you think?

561
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,743
STUDENT: If you add them
together, you just get c.

562
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:40,900
PROFESSOR: If you add
them together you get c.

563
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,185
Well, actually,
that's almost right.

564
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:45,810
That's not what you
want to do, though.

565
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,620
You don't want to add them.

566
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,930
You want to subtract them.

567
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,750
So let's see what happens
when you subtract them.

568
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm going to ignore the
c, for the time being.

569
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:05,520
I get sin^2 x, 1/2 sin^2
x - (-1/2 cos^2 x).

570
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,880
So the difference between
them, we hope to be 0.

571
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,760
But actually of
course it's not 0.

572
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,680
What it is, is it's 1/2 sine
squared plus cosine squared,

573
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,850
which is 1/2.

574
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:24,200
It's not 0, it's a constant.

575
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,310
So what's really going on here
is that these two formulas

576
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,290
are the same.

577
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,740
But you have to understand
how to interpret them.

578
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,450
The two constants, here's
a constant up here.

579
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,900
There's a constant, c_1
associated to this one.

580
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,250
There's a different constant,
c_2 associated to this one.

581
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,960
And this family of functions
for all possible c_1's

582
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,860
and all possible c_2's, is
the same family of functions.

583
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,940
Now, what's the relationship
between c_1 and c_2?

584
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,210
Well, if you do the
subtraction, c_1 - c_2

585
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,240
has to be equal to 1/2.

586
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:06,610
They're both constants,
but they differ by 1/2.

587
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,404
So this explains,
when you're dealing

588
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:10,820
with families of things, they
don't have to look the same.

589
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,560
And there are lots
of trig functions

590
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,280
which look a little different.

591
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,050
So there can be several formulas
that actually are the same.

592
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,960
And it's hard to check that
they're actually the same.

593
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,950
You need some trig
identities to do it.

594
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:55,210
Let's do one more example here.

595
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:06,250
Here's another one.

596
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:13,510
Now, you may be thinking,
and a lot of people

597
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:22,250
are, thinking ugh,
it's got a ln in it.

598
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,400
If you're experienced,
you actually

599
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,130
can read off the
answer just the way

600
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,088
there were several people
who were shouting out

601
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:31,000
the answers when we were doing
the rest of these problems.

602
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,970
But, you do need to relax.

603
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,790
Because in this case, now
this is definitely not

604
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,490
true in general when
we do integrals.

605
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,080
But, for now, when
we do integrals,

606
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,570
they'll all be manageable.

607
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,670
And there's only one method.

608
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,390
Which is substitution.

609
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,680
And in the substitution
method, you

610
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,200
want to go for the
trickiest part.

611
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,220
And substitute for that.

612
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,630
So the substitution
that I proposed

613
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,200
to you is that this should
be, u should be ln x.

614
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,270
And the advantage that that
has is that its differential

615
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,720
is simpler than itself.

616
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,570
So du = dx / x.

617
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,500
Remember, we use that in
logarithmic differentiation,

618
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,550
too.

619
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:28,810
So now we can express this
using this substitution.

620
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,290
And what we get is,
the integral of,

621
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,990
so I'll divide the
two parts here.

622
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,515
It's 1 / ln x, and
then it's dx / x.

623
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:43,370
And this part is 1 /
u, and this part is du.

624
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:49,260
So it's the integral of du / u.

625
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:58,490
And that is ln u + c.

626
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:11,030
Which altogether, if I put back
in what u is, is ln (ln x) + c.

627
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,290
And now we see
some uglier things.

628
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,900
In fact, technically
speaking, we

629
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,730
could take the
absolute value here.

630
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:28,130
And then this would be
absolute values there.

631
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:33,090
So this is the type of
example where I really

632
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,740
would recommend that you
actually use the substitution,

633
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,030
at least for now.

634
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,820
All right, tomorrow
we're going to be

635
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,080
doing differential equations.

636
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,130
And we're going to
review for the test.

637
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,649
I'm going to give you a handout
telling you just exactly

638
00:48:47,649 --> 00:48:48,940
what's going to be on the test.

639
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,298
So, see you tomorrow.
