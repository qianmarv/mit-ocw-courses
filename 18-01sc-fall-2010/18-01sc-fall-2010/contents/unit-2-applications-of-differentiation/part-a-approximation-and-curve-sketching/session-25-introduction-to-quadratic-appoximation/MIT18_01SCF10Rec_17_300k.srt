JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,360
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,600
In lecture you've started
learning about quadratic

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,560
approximation.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,540
So today we're just going to
do a quick example of it.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,870
So I have a question written
here on the board.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,400
What is the quadratic
approximation of the function

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,230
f of x equals e to the x plus x
squared-- so here x and plus

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,890
x squared is the exponent, so
it's e to the quantity x plus

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,760
x squared--

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,340
near x equals 0.

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,060
So why don't you take a minute
or two, pause the video, work

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,800
this out on your own and
then come back and

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,050
we can do it together.

16
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,620

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,120
All right.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,860
Welcome back.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,520
So there are two different ways
we can do this problem.

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,800
Let's first just do it the
totally straightforward way,

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,060
which is that you have this
formula for quadratic

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,680
approximations in terms of the
derivatives of your function.

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,350
And so, so we can just
apply that formula.

24
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,370
So here, so the formula
is that the quadratic

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,040
approximation of the
function f--

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,220
so here, near the point 0--

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:17,640
is equal to f of 0 plus f prime
of 0 x plus f double

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,030
prime of 0 over 2
times x squared.

29
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,640
All right.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,340
So in order to use this formula
we just need to know

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,300
what the derivatives of
our function are and

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,540
their values at 0.

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,470
So first we can do the first
derivative of f.

34
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,210
So for that it's just a
straightforward application of

35
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,190
the chain rule.

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,676
Our outer function is e to the
x and our inner function is x

37
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:46,820
plus x squared.

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,630
So the derivative, then applying
the chain rule is e

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:58,470
to the x plus x squared times
1 plus 2x, which I can also

40
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,260
write as e--

41
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,510
well, yeah, let me
just reorder it--

42
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,700
2x plus 1 times e to the
x plus x squared.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:11,980
OK.

44
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,290
So that's the first
derivative.

45
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,500
And for the second derivative
I can apply just the

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,250
product rule here.

47
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,600
Right?

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,840
So I've got this, you know--

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,770
the second derivative is the
derivative of the first

50
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,330
derivative--

51
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,170
so here I have a product.

52
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,590
So f double prime of x is equal
to-- well, so we take

53
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,930
the derivative of the first
one, which is just--

54
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:39,720
2 times the second plus the
derivative of the second one.

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,920
Well, the second one is e
to the x plus x squared.

56
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,740
It's actually f of x, so we
already computed it once.

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,730
So the derivative of the second
is 2x plus 1 e to the x

58
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,930
plus x squared times
the first. So times

59
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,370
another 2x plus 1.

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,670
OK, and if I multiply these two
together and combine all

61
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:11,000
my terms, this is 4x squared
plus 4x plus 3 times e to the

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,340
x plus x squared.

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,800
So these are the first and
second derivatives, and what I

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,200
need to plug them into
my formula is I need

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,800
their values at 0.

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,380
So I need the function
value at 0.

67
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,990
So f of 0, well that's e to
the 0 plus 0 squared.

68
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,570
So it's e to the 0,
so that's just 1.

69
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,470
f prime at 0, let's see, I go
over to my formula for f prime

70
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,640
and I plug in x equals 0, so
I have 2 times 0 plus 1, so

71
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,430
that's 1 times e to the 0.

72
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,920
So that's 1 times 1,
that's also 1.

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,640
And for f double time at 0, I go
to my formula for f double

74
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,850
prime and I put in 0.

75
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,190
And so this is 0 and that's 0.

76
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,120
So I have a 3 times
1 so that's 3.

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,630
And now I just take these three
values and I plug them

78
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,790
right into my formula.

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:16,740
So the quadratic approximation
is Q of f equals 1 plus x plus

80
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,880
3x squared over 2.

81
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,320
All right.

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,300
Great.

83
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,490
So that was one way to
do this problem.

84
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,410
Another way to do this problem
is the following.

85
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,020
And in this case, I'm not sure
which way is simpler, but in

86
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,930
some cases one way is clearly
easier than the other.

87
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,470
So if we illustrate both then
you'll have twice as many

88
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,800
tools to work with.

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,730
So the other way
is to notice--

90
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,240
so the exponential function is
nice when you have, you know,

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,750
one of your exponential
rules--

92
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,190
is that the exponential of a
sum is the product of the

93
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,960
exponentials.

94
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,920
So we can rewrite f of x equals
e to the x times e to

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,360
the x squared.

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,260
Now this may seem a little bit
silly to you, but if you

97
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,920
watched Christine's recitation
video you saw that to find the

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,120
quadratic approximation to a
product, it's enough to find

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,390
the quadratic approximations
to each piece separately,

100
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,430
multiply together, and then
take that quadratic

101
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,370
approximation.

102
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,690
So in this case the quadratic
approximations are things you

103
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,910
might already know.

104
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,470
So in particular, we saw in--
sorry-- in lecture that the

105
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,290
quadratic approximation of e
to the x is 1 plus x plus x

106
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,460
squared over 2.

107
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,080
And I'm going to tell you--

108
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,740
if you haven't seen it in
recitation, there are a bunch

109
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,640
of different ways you could
work it out for yourself--

110
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,910
but the quadratic approximation
for e to the x

111
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,386
squared is equal to
1 plus x squared.

112
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:54,000
All right, so if you don't
believe me, by all means work

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,710
that out for yourself
to check it.

114
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,740
So in this case, so that means
that the quadratic

115
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,920
approximation of
f is equal to--

116
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,000
by the rule Christine
showed you--

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,480
it's the, so it's equal to the
quadratic approximation of the

118
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,860
product of the quadratic
approximations.

119
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,640
So that's 1 plus x plus
x squared over 2

120
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,420
times 1 plus x squared.

121
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,580
Now if you multiply these two
out, that's not hard.

122
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,670
There are six terms. So this is
the quadratic approximation

123
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:31,310
of 1 plus x plus x
squared over 2.

124
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,340
So multiply 1 through here
and now x squared.

125
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,375
So that's plus x squared
plus x cubed plus--

126
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:46,380
OK, some fourth degree term--
x to the fourth over 2.

127
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,400
And now the quadratic
approximation to this we get

128
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,710
just by dropping the cubic and
quartic terms. So, and OK, and

129
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,240
we can add these two square
terms together So this is

130
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,770
equal to 1 plus x plus
3x squared over 2.

131
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,080
All right.

132
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,480
And luckily, doing the same
problem two different ways we

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,190
get the same answer, which
is what should happen.

134
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,900
So that's that.

135
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,164
