PROF.

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,660
JERISON: So, we're ready
to begin Lecture 10,

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,860
and what I'm going to begin
with is by finishing up

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,880
some things from last time.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:42,460
We'll talk about
approximations, and I

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,650
want to fill in a
number of comments

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,440
and get you a little bit more
oriented in the point of view

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,980
that I'm trying to express
about approximations.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,790
So, first of all, I
want to remind you

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,800
of the actual applied example
that I wrote down last time.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,730
So that was this business here.

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,590
There was something
from special relativity.

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,990
And the approximation that
we used was the linear

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,170
approximation, with a -1/2 power
that comes out to be T(1 + 1/2

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,670
v^2/c^2).

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,850
I want to reiterate why this
is a useful way of thinking

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,930
of things.

25
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,830
And why this is that this
comes up in real life.

26
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,090
Why this is maybe more
important than everything

27
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,820
that I've taught you
about technically so far.

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,750
So, first of all, what this is
telling us is the change in T

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,430
divided by T, if you do the
arithmetic here and subtract T,

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,970
that's using the change
in T is T' - T here.

31
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,440
If you work that out, this is
approximately the same as 1/2

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,140
v^2/c^2.

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,270
So what is this saying?

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,580
This is saying that if you
have this satellite, which

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,610
is going at speed v, and
little c is the speed of light,

36
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,060
then the change in the
watch down here on earth,

37
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,770
relative to the time
on the satellite,

38
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,050
is going to be proportional
to this ratio here.

39
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,710
So, physically,
this makes sense.

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,120
This is time divided by time.

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,670
And this is velocity squared
divided by velocity squared.

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,620
So, in each case,
the units divide out.

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,880
So this is a
dimensionless quantity.

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,960
And this is a
dimensionless quantity.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,840
And the only point here
that we're trying to make

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,440
is just this notion
of proportionality.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,470
So I want to write this down.

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,010
Just-- in summary.

49
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,210
So the error
fraction, if you like,

50
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,630
which is sort of the number
of significant digits

51
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:03,090
that we have in our measurement,
is proportional, in this case,

52
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,860
to this quantity.

53
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,030
It happens to be proportional
to this quantity here.

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:16,980
And the factor is,
happens to be, 1/2.

55
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,350
So these proportionality factors
are what we're looking for.

56
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,404
Their rates of change.

57
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,820
Their rates of
change of something

58
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,550
with respect to something else.

59
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,800
Now, on your homework,
you have something

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,740
rather similar to this.

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:38,460
So in Problem, on Part
2B, Part II, Problem 1,

62
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,580
there's the speed
of a pitch, right?

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,100
And the speed of the pitch
is changing depending

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
on how high the mound is.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,460
And the point here
is that that's

66
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,150
approximately
proportional to the change

67
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,320
in the height of the mound.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,290
In that problem, we
had this delta h,

69
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,830
that was the x variable
in that problem.

70
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,330
And what you're
trying to figure out

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,904
is what the constant
of proportionality is.

72
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,820
That's what you're aiming
for in this problem.

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,070
So there's a linear
relationship, approximately,

74
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,890
to all intents and purposes
this is an equality.

75
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,290
Because the lower
order terms are

76
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,720
unimportant for the problem.

77
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,020
Just as over here, this function
is a little bit complicated.

78
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,800
This function is a
little more simple.

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
For the purposes of this
problem, they are the same.

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,370
Because the errors
are negligible

81
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,760
for the particular problem
that we're working on.

82
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,210
So we might as well work with
the simpler relationship.

83
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,621
And similarly, over here,
so you could do this with,

84
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,120
in this case with
square roots, it's

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,980
not so hard here with
reciprocals of square roots.

86
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,300
It's also not terribly
hard to do it numerically.

87
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,850
And the reason why we're
not doing it numerically

88
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,260
is that, as I say,
this is something that

89
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,560
happens all across engineering.

90
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,640
People are looking for
these linear relationships

91
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,240
between the change in some input
and the change in the output.

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,210
And if you don't make
these simplifications,

93
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,760
then when you get, say,
a dozen of them together,

94
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,540
you can't figure
out what's going on.

95
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,640
In this case the design of the
satellite, it's very important.

96
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,160
The speed actually
isn't just one speed.

97
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,070
Because it's the relative
speed of you to the satellite.

98
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,349
And you might be-- it depends
on your angle of sight

99
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:22,890
with the satellite
what the speed is.

100
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,300
So it varies quite a bit.

101
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,280
So you really need
this rule of thumb.

102
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,372
Then there are all kinds
of other considerations

103
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:29,080
in this question.

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,852
Like, for example,
there's the fact

105
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,530
that we're sitting on Earth
and so we're rotating around

106
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,250
on what's called a
non-inertial frame.

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,721
So there's the question
of that acceleration.

108
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,220
There's the question that the
gravity that I experience here

109
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,830
on Earth is not the same
as up at the satellite.

110
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,870
And that also creates
a difference in time,

111
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,580
as a result of
general relativity.

112
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,400
So all of these
considerations come down

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,030
to formulas which are
this complicated or maybe

114
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,910
a tiny bit more.

115
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,330
Not really that much.

116
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,700
And then people simplify
them enormously to these very

117
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,090
simple-minded rules.

118
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,130
And they don't keep
track of what's going on.

119
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,830
So in order to
design the system,

120
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,960
you must make these
simplifications,

121
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,630
otherwise you can't even
think about what's going on.

122
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,860
This comes up in everything.

123
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,422
In weather forecasting,
economic forecasting.

124
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,880
Figuring out whether there's
going to be an asteroid that's

125
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,140
going to hit the Earth.

126
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,970
Every single one of
these things involves

127
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,900
dozens of these considerations.

128
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,951
OK, there was a question
that I saw, here.

129
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:30,450
Yes.

130
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:38,821
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

131
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:39,320
PROF.

132
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,120
JERISON: Yeah.

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,950
Basically, any
problem where you have

134
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,840
a derivative, the
rate of change also

135
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,017
depends upon what
the base point is.

136
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:46,850
That's the question.

137
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,070
You're saying, doesn't
this delta v also

138
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,050
depend, I had a base
point in that problem.

139
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,290
I happened to decide that
pitchers pitch on average

140
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,350
about 90 miles an hour.

141
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,327
Whereas, in fact, some pitchers
pitch at 100 miles an hour,

142
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,410
some pitch at 80 miles an
hour, and of course they

143
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,040
vary the speed of the pitch.

144
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,510
And so, this varies
a little bit.

145
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,426
In fact, that's sort of
a second order effect.

146
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,220
It does change the constant
of proportionality.

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,790
It's a rate of change at
a different base point.

148
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,230
Which we're considering fixed.

149
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,060
In fact, that's sort of
a second order effect.

150
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,700
When you actually do the
computations, what you discover

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,940
is that it doesn't make
that much difference.

152
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,630
To the a.

153
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,040
And that's something that
you get from experience.

154
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,980
That it turns out, which things
matter and which things don't.

155
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,820
And yet again, that's exactly
the same sort of consideration

156
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,472
but at the next order of what
I'm talking about here is.

157
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:36,430
You have to have enough
experience with numbers

158
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,992
to know that if you take, if
you vary something a little bit

159
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,950
it's not going to change
the answer that you're

160
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,680
looking for very much.

161
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,530
And that's exactly the
point that I'm making.

162
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,830
So I can't make them all
at once, all such points.

163
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,290
So that's my pitch for
understanding things

164
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,470
from this point of view.

165
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:02,000
Now, we're going to go on, now,
to quadratic approximations,

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:13,290
which are a little
more complicated.

167
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,920
So, we talked a little
bit about this last time

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,850
but I didn't finish.

169
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,930
So I want to finish this up.

170
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,320
And the first thing
that I should say

171
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,740
is that you use these when the
linear approximation is not

172
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,680
enough.

173
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,270
OK, so, that's something
that you really

174
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,390
need to get a little
experience with.

175
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,810
In economics, I told
you they use logarithms.

176
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,030
So sometimes they use
log-linear functions.

177
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,010
Sometimes they use
log-quadratic functions

178
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,860
when the log-linear
ones don't work.

179
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,472
So most modeling in economics
is with log-quadratic functions.

180
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:55,680
And if you've made it any
more complicated than that,

181
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,740
it's useless.

182
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,850
And it's a mess.

183
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,810
And people don't do it.

184
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,790
So they stick with the
quadratic ones, typically.

185
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,010
So the basic formula here,
and I'm going to take the base

186
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:14,380
point to be 0, is that f(x) is
approximately f(0) + f'(0) x.

187
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,100
That's the linear part.

188
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,174
Plus this extra term.

189
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:18,090
Which is f''(0)/2 x^2.

190
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,740
And this is supposed
to work for x near 0.

191
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:34,310
So I've chosen the base
point as simply as possible.

192
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,060
So here's more or less
where we left off last time.

193
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,710
And one thing that I said
I was going to explain,

194
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:48,390
which I will now, is
why it's 1/2 f''(0).

195
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,610
So we need to know that.

196
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,770
So let's work that
out here first of all.

197
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,290
So I'm just going
to do it by example.

198
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,860
So if you like, the
answer is just, well,

199
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,600
what happens when
you have a parabola?

200
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
A parabola's a quadratic.

201
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,250
It had better-- its quadratic
approximation had better

202
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,314
be itself.

203
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,480
It's got to be the best one.

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,010
So it's got to be itself.

205
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,240
So this formula, if
it's going to work,

206
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,890
has to work on the nose,
for quadratic functions.

207
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,770
So, let's take a look.

208
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,130
If I differentiate,
I get b + 2cx.

209
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,230
If I differentiate a
second time, I get 2c.

210
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,580
And now let's plug it in.

211
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,450
Well, we can recover, what is
it that we want to recover?

212
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,150
We want to recover
these numbers a, b and c

213
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,930
using the derivatives
evaluated at 0.

214
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,500
So let's see.

215
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,210
It's pretty easy, actually.

216
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,569
f(0) = a.

217
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,360
That's on the nose.

218
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,070
If you plug in x = 0 here, these
terms drop out and you get a.

219
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,220
And now, f'(0),
whoops that was wrong.

220
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,100
So I wrote f' but
what I meant was f.

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,950
So f(0) is a.

222
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,200
Let's back up.

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,130
f(0) is a, so if I
plug in x = 0 I get a.

224
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,220
Now, f'(0), that's
this next formula here,

225
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,180
f'(0), I plug in 0
here, and I get b.

226
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,220
That's also good.

227
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,220
And that's exactly what
the linear approximation

228
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,540
is supposed to be.

229
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,480
But now you notice, f'' is 2c.

230
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,440
So to recover c, I
better take half of it.

231
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,120
And that's it.

232
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,010
That's the reason.

233
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,690
There's no chance that any
other formula could work.

234
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,050
And this one does.

235
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,310
So that's the explanation
for the formula.

236
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,215
And now I remind you that I had
a collection of basic formulas

237
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,090
written on the board.

238
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,700
And I want to just make sure
we know all of them again.

239
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:07,580
So, first of all, there was
sine x is approximately x.

240
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,610
Cosine x is approximately
1 - 1/2 x^2.

241
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,230
And e^x is approximately
1 + x + 1/2 x^2.

242
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,230
So those were three that
I mentioned last time.

243
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:28,980
And, again, this is
all for x near 0.

244
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,160
All for x near 0 only.

245
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,360
These are wildly wrong far
away, but near 0 they're

246
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,730
nice, good, quadratic
approximations.

247
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,300
Now, the other
two approximations

248
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,960
that I want to mention
are the logarithm,

249
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
and we use the
base point shifted.

250
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,500
So we can put it at x near 0.

251
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,545
And this one - sorry, this is an
approximately equals sign there

252
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:59,410
- turns out to be x - 1/2 x^2.

253
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:08,979
And the last one is (1+x)^r,
which turns out to be 1 + rx +

254
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:09,520
r(r-1)/2 x^2.

255
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,980
Now, eventually, your mind
will converge on all of these

256
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,380
and you'll find them
relatively easy to memorize.

257
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,820
But it'll take some
getting used to.

258
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,670
And I'm not claiming that
you should recognize them

259
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,370
and understand them all now.

260
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,630
But I'm going to put a
giant box around this.

261
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,793
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

262
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:42,293
PROF.

263
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:42,834
JERISON: Yes.

264
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,543
So the question was,
you get all of these

265
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:45,834
if you use that equation there.

266
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,500
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

267
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,350
So I already did it actually
for these three, last time.

268
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,880
But I didn't do it
yet for these two.

269
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,490
But I will do it in
about two minutes.

270
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,405
Well, maybe five minutes.

271
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:10,410
But first I want to explain
just a few things about these.

272
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,850
They all follow from
the basic formula.

273
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,780
In fact, that one deserves
a pink box too, doesn't it.

274
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,020
That one's pretty important.

275
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,770
Alright.

276
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,020
Yeah.

277
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,100
Maybe even some little sparkles.

278
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,830
Alright.

279
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,430
OK.

280
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,390
So that's pretty important.

281
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,900
Almost as important as the more
basic one without this term

282
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,190
here.

283
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,480
So now, let me just tell
you a little bit more

284
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,740
about the significance.

285
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,641
Again, this is just
to reinforce something

286
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:57,640
that we've already done.

287
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,264
But it's closely
related to what you're

288
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,880
doing on your problem set.

289
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,230
So it's worth your
while to recall this.

290
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,870
So, there's this expression
that we were dealing with.

291
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,370
And we talked about
it in lecture.

292
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,610
And we showed that this tends
to e as k goes to infinity.

293
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,110
So that's what we
showed in lecture.

294
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,310
And the way that we did that
was, we took the logarithm

295
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,320
and we wrote it
as k times, sorry,

296
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,640
the logarithm of 1 + 1/k.

297
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,780
And then we evaluated
the limit of this.

298
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,000
And I want to do
this limit again,

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,220
using linear approximation.

300
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,660
To show you how easy it
is if you just remember

301
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,820
the linear approximation.

302
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,720
And then we'll explain where the
quadratic approximation comes

303
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,390
in.

304
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,770
So I claim that this
is approximately

305
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,470
equal to k times 1/k.

306
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,750
Now, why is that?

307
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,350
Well, that's just this
linear approximation.

308
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,500
So what did I use here?

309
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:14,760
I used log of 1+x is
approximately x, for x = 1/k.

310
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,600
That's what I used in
this approximation here.

311
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,330
And that's the
linear approximation

312
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,010
to the natural logarithm.

313
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,250
And this number is
relatively easy to evaluate.

314
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,150
I know how to do it.

315
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,010
It's equal to 1.

316
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,680
That's the same, well,
so where does this work?

317
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,450
This works where
this thing is near 0.

318
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,610
Which is when k is
going to infinity.

319
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,170
This thing is working only
when k is going to infinity.

320
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,660
So what it's really saying,
this approximation formula,

321
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,690
it's really saying that as
we go to infinity, in k,

322
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,720
this thing is going to 1.

323
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,890
As k goes to infinity.

324
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,410
So that's what it's saying.

325
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,740
That's the substance there.

326
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,200
And that's how we want to
use it, in many instances.

327
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,580
Just to evaluate limits.

328
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,180
We also want to realize
that it's nearby

329
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,800
when k is pretty large, like
100 or something like that.

330
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,660
Now, so that's the idea of
the linear approximation.

331
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,920
Now, if you want to get the
rate of convergence here,

332
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,950
so the rate of what's
called convergence.

333
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:34,260
So convergence means how fast
this is going towards that.

334
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,220
What I have to do is
take the difference.

335
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,670
I have to take ln a_k, and I
have to subtract 1 from it.

336
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,420
And I know that
this is going to 0,

337
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,870
and the question
is how big is this.

338
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,760
We want it to be very small.

339
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,490
And the answer
we're going to get,

340
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:03,570
so the answer just uses the
quadratic approximation.

341
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,520
So if I just have a little
bit more detail, then

342
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,720
this expression
here, in other words,

343
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,210
I have the next
higher-order term.

344
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,420
This is like 1/k,
this is like 1 / k^2.

345
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,890
Then I can understand
how big the difference

346
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,260
is between the expression
that I've got and its limit.

347
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,200
And so that's what's
on your homework.

348
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,610
This is on your problem set.

349
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,050
OK, so that is more or
less an explanation for one

350
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,860
of the things that quadratic
approximations are good for.

351
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,900
And I'm going to give you
one more illustration.

352
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,360
One more illustration.

353
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,472
And then we'll actually
check these formulas.

354
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:48,430
Yeah, another question.

355
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:55,520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

356
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,020
PROF.

357
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,470
JERISON: That's a very
good question here.

358
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,260
When they, which in
this case means maybe,

359
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,510
me, when I give you
a question, does one

360
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:13,030
specify whether you want to
use a linear or a quadratic

361
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,430
approximation.

362
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,910
The answer is, in
real life when you're

363
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,470
faced with a problem like
this, where some satellite is

364
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,700
orbiting and you want to
know the effects of gravity

365
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,304
or something like that, nobody
is going to tell you anything.

366
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:29,720
They're not even
going to tell you

367
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,480
whether a linear approximation
is relevant, or a quadratic

368
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,740
or anything.

369
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,170
So you're on your own.

370
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,830
When I give you a question,
at least for right now,

371
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm always going to tell you.

372
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
But as time goes on
I'd like you to get

373
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,360
used to when it's
enough to get away

374
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,840
with a linear approximation.

375
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,540
And you should only use
a quadratic approximation

376
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,690
if somebody forces you to.

377
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,960
You should always start
trying with a linear one.

378
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,610
Because the quadratic ones are
much more complicated as you'll

379
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,390
see in this next example.

380
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,320
OK, so the example
that I want to use

381
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,740
is, you're going to be
stuck with it because I'm

382
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,110
asking for the quadratic.

383
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:16,190
So we're going to find the
quadratic approximation

384
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:23,740
near-- for x near 0.

385
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,525
To what?

386
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,360
Well, this is the
same function that we

387
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,840
used in the last lecture.

388
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,880
I think this was it.

389
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,090
e^(-3x) (1+x)^(-1/2).

390
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,670
OK.

391
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,060
So, unfortunately, I stuck
it in the wrong place

392
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,620
to be able to fit this
very long formula here.

393
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,100
So I'm going to switch it.

394
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:57,070
I'm just going to write it here.

395
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,140
And we're going to just
do the approximation.

396
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,830
So we're going to say
quadratic, in parentheses.

397
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,450
And we'll say x near 0.

398
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,160
So that's what I want.

399
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,424
So now, here's
what I have to do.

400
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:17,590
Well, I have to write in
the quadratic approximation

401
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:25,710
for e^(-3x), and I'm going to
use this formula right here.

402
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:33,970
And so that's 1 +
(-3x) + (-3x)^2 / 2.

403
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,530
And the other factor,
I'm going to have

404
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,910
to use this formula down here.

405
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,460
Because r is - 1/2.

406
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,300
And so that's 1 - 1/2 x
+ 1/2 (-1/2)(-3/2)x^2.

407
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:09,970
So this is the r term, and
this is the r - 1 term.

408
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,630
And now I'm going
to do something

409
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,550
which is the only good thing
about quadratic approximations.

410
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,660
They're messy, they're
long, there's nothing

411
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,450
particularly good about them.

412
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,670
But there is one good
thing about them.

413
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,610
Which is that you always get to
ignore the higher order terms.

414
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,420
So even though this looks like
a very ugly multiplication,

415
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,590
I can do it in my head.

416
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,940
Just watching it.

417
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,710
Because I get a 1 * 1, I'm
forced with that term here.

418
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,200
And then I get the cross
terms which are linear,

419
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,150
which is -3x - 1/2 x.

420
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,460
We already did that
when we calculated

421
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,550
the linear
approximation, so that's

422
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,670
this times the 1 and
this times that 1.

423
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,230
And now I have three cross
terms which are quadratic.

424
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,880
So one of them is these two
linear terms are multiplying.

425
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,160
So that's plus 3/2 x^2.

426
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,210
That's -3 times -1/2.

427
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,160
And then there's this
term, multiplying the 1,

428
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,730
that's plus 9/2 x^2.

429
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,080
And then there's one last term,
which is this monster here.

430
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:23,260
Multiplying 1, and that is -3/8.

431
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:31,430
So the great thing is, we
drop x^3, x^4, etc., terms.

432
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:37,930
Yeah?

433
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,656
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

434
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:40,156
PROF.

435
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:42,500
JERISON: OK, well
so copy it down.

436
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,620
And you work it out
as I'm doing it now.

437
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,930
So what I did is, I
multiplied 1 by 1.

438
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,290
I'm using the
distributive law here.

439
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,560
That was this one.

440
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,120
I multiplied this 3x by this
one, that was that term.

441
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,550
I multiplied this by
this, that's that term.

442
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,120
And then I multiplied
this by this.

443
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,860
In other words, two x
terms that gave me an x^2

444
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,940
and a (-3)(-1/2).

445
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,499
And I'm going to
stop at that point.

446
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,290
Because the point is
it's just all the rest

447
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,230
of the terms that come up.

448
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,320
Now, the reason, the only
reason why it's easy,

449
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,319
is that I only have to
go up to x squared terms.

450
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,462
I don't have to do
the higher ones.

451
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:22,795
Another question, way back here.

452
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,545
Yeah, right there.

453
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:28,696
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

454
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:29,196
PROF.

455
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:29,696
JERISON: OK.

456
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:38,690
So somebody can check
my arithmetic, too.

457
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,470
Good.

458
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,361
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

459
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:40,861
PROF.

460
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:43,466
JERISON: Why do I get to drop
all the higher-order terms.

461
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:46,210
So, that's because
the situation where

462
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm going to apply this is
the situation in which x is,

463
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,610
say, 1/100.

464
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,030
So here's about 1/100.

465
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,210
Here's something which
is on the order of 1/100.

466
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,130
This is on the order of 1/100^2.

467
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,450
1/100^2, all of these terms.

468
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,400
Now, these cubic and quartic
terms are of the order

469
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,520
of 1/100^3.

470
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,420
That's 10^(-6).

471
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,420
6.

472
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,730
And the point is
that I'm not claiming

473
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,230
that I have an exact answer.

474
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,950
And I'm going to drop things
of that order of magnitude.

475
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,890
So I'm saving everything
up to 4 decimal places.

476
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm throwing away things which
are 6 decimal places out.

477
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,870
Does that answer your question?

478
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,211
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

479
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:35,710
PROF.

480
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,370
JERISON: So.

481
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,770
That's the situation, and now
you can combine the terms.

482
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,780
I mean, it's not
very impressive here.

483
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:54,300
This is equal to 1 - 7/2
x, maybe, plus 51/8 x^2.

484
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,530
If I've made that-- if those
minus signs hadn't canceled,

485
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,560
I would have gotten
the wrong answer here.

486
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,140
Anyway.

487
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,430
So, this is a 2 here, sorry.

488
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,920
7/2.

489
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,864
This is the linear
approximation we got last time

490
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:09,530
and here's the extra
information that we

491
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,540
got from this calculation.

492
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:17,650
Which is this 51/8 term.

493
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,620
Right, you have to
accept that there's

494
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,890
a certain degree of
complexity to this problem

495
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,840
and the answer is
sufficiently complicated

496
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,740
so it can't be less
arithmetic because we

497
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,380
get this peculiar
51/8 there, right.

498
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,950
So one of the
things to realize is

499
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,120
that these kinds of problems,
because they involve

500
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,135
many, many terms
are always going

501
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:43,960
to involve a little bit
of complicated arithmetic.

502
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,910
Last little bit,
I did promise you

503
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,360
that I was going to derive
these two relations, as I said.

504
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,020
Did the ones in the left column.

505
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,640
So let's carry that out.

506
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,400
And as someone just pointed out,
it all comes from this formula

507
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,900
here.

508
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,710
So let's just check it.

509
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,160
So we'll start with
the log function.

510
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,810
This is the function, f,
and then f' is 1/(1+x).

511
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:24,620
And f'', so this is f', this
is f'', is - -1 / (1+x)^2.

512
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,730
And now I have to plug in x = 0.

513
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,180
So at x = 0 this is
ln 1, which is 0.

514
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,860
So this is at x = 0.

515
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,850
I'm getting 0 here, I
plug in 0 and I get 1.

516
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,720
And here, I plug
in 0 and I get -1.

517
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,050
So now I go and I look
up at that formula,

518
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,270
which is way in that
upper corner there.

519
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,420
And I see that the coefficient
on the constant is 0.

520
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,260
The coefficient on x is 1.

521
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,290
And then the other coefficient,
the very last one, is -1/2.

522
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,010
So this is the -1 here.

523
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,340
And then in the formula,
there's a 2 in the denominator.

524
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,400
So it's half of whatever I get
for this second derivative,

525
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,590
at 0.

526
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,100
So this is the
approximation formula, which

527
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,260
is way up in that corner there.

528
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,290
Similarly, if I
do it for (1+x)^r,

529
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,990
I have to differentiate
that, I get r(1+x)^(r-1),

530
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,300
and then r(r-1)(x+1)^(r-2).

531
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,830
So here are the derivatives.

532
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:41,110
And so if I evaluate
them at x = 0, I get 1.

533
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,240
That's 1^r is 1.

534
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,910
And here I get r.

535
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,580
1^(r-1) times r.

536
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,010
And here, I plug in x
= 0 and I get r(r-1).

537
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,880
So again, the pattern
is right above it here.

538
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,300
The 1 is there, the r is there.

539
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,920
And then instead of
r(r-1), I have half that.

540
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:21,480
For the coefficient.

541
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,660
So these are just examples.

542
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,700
Obviously if we had a
more complicated function,

543
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,050
we might carry this out.

544
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,210
But as a practical
matter, we try

545
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,810
to stick with the
ones in the pink box

546
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:42,460
and just use algebra
to get other formulas.

547
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,430
So I want to shift gears now
and treat the subject that was

548
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,910
supposed to be this lecture.

549
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,230
And we're not quite
caught up, but we

550
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,890
will try to do our best to
do as much as we can today.

551
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,880
So the next topic
is curve sketching.

552
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:18,120
And so let's get
started with that.

553
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,950
So now, happily in this
subject, there are more pictures

554
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,880
and it's a little
bit more geometric.

555
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,420
And there's relatively
little computation.

556
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,600
So let's hope we can do this.

557
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,890
So I want to-- so
here we go, we'll

558
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:44,930
start with curve sketching.

559
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,520
And the goal here--

560
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:56,410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

561
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:56,910
PROF.

562
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,880
JERISON: So that's like
'liner', the last time.

563
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:09,600
That's kind of sketchy
spelling, isn't it?

564
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,800
Yeah, there are certain kinds
of things which I can't spell.

565
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,640
But, all right.

566
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,741
Sketching.

567
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:19,240
Alright.

568
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,350
So here's our goal.

569
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:38,280
Our goal is to draw the
graph of f, using f' and f''.

570
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,190
Whether they're
positive or negative.

571
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,440
So that's it.

572
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,400
This is the goal here.

573
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,020
However, there is a big warning
that I want to give you.

574
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:04,000
And this is one
that unfortunately

575
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,005
I now have to make you
unlearn, especially

576
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,380
those that you
that have actually

577
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,700
had a little bit of
calculus before, I

578
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,929
want to make you unlearn
some of your instincts

579
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:13,720
that you developed.

580
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,511
So this will be harder
for those of you who

581
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:19,840
have actually done this before.

582
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,650
But for the rest of you,
it will be relatively easy.

583
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:35,490
Which is, don't abandon
your precalculus skills.

584
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:42,380
And common sense.

585
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,760
So there's a great deal
of common sense in this.

586
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,555
And it actually trumps
some of the calculus.

587
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:56,190
The calculus just fills in
what you didn't quite know yet.

588
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,660
So I will try to
illustrate this.

589
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,390
And because we're
running a bit late,

590
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,910
I won't get to the some
of the main punchlines

591
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,970
until next lecture.

592
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,380
But I want you to do it.

593
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,412
So for now, I'm just
going to tell you

594
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:10,620
about the general principles.

595
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,100
And in the process I'm going
to introduce the terminology.

596
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,167
Just, the words that we
need to use to describe what

597
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,000
is that we're doing.

598
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,375
And there's also
a certain amount

599
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,160
of carelessness with that
in many of the treatments

600
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,070
that you'll see.

601
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,750
And a lot of hastiness.

602
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,350
So just be a little patient
and we will do this.

603
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,740
So, the first principle
is the following.

604
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,670
If f' is positive,
then f is increasing.

605
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,530
That's a straightforward
idea, and it's closely related

606
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,730
to this tangent
line approximation

607
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,220
or the linear approximation
that I just did.

608
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,230
You can just imagine.

609
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,050
Here's the tangent line,
here's the function.

610
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,680
And if the tangent
line is pointing up,

611
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,490
then the function is
also going up, too.

612
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,310
So that's all that's
going on here.

613
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:10,370
Similarly, if f' is negative,
then f is decreasing.

614
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,220
And that's the basic idea.

615
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,170
Now, the second step is
also fairly straightforward.

616
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,130
It's just a second-order
effect of the same type.

617
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:29,190
If you have f'' as positive,
then that means that f' is

618
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,150
increasing.

619
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,740
That's the same principle
applied one step up.

620
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,320
Right?

621
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,880
Because if f'' is positive,
that means it's the derivative

622
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,710
of f'.

623
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,970
So it's the same
principle just repeated.

624
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,710
And now I just want to
draw a picture of this.

625
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,470
Here's a picture of it, I claim.

626
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,790
And it looks like
something's going down.

627
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,430
And I did that on purpose.

628
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,650
But there is something
that's increasing here.

629
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,470
Which is, the slope is
very steep negative here.

630
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,330
And it's less steep
negative over here.

631
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,790
So we have the slope which is
some negative number, say, -4.

632
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,500
And here it's -3.

633
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,800
So it's increasing.

634
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,250
It's getting less negative,
and maybe eventually it'll

635
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,680
curve up the other way.

636
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,180
And this is a picture of
what I'm talking about here.

637
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,630
That's what it means to
say that f' is increasing.

638
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,020
The slope is getting larger.

639
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:34,930
And the way to describe a curve
like this is that it's concave.

640
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:41,620
So f is concave up.

641
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:49,320
And similarly, f'' negative is
going to be the same thing as f

642
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:59,770
concave-- or implies
f concave down.

643
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:04,850
So those are the ways in
which derivatives will help us

644
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,270
qualitatively to draw graphs.

645
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,880
But as I said
before, we still have

646
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,360
to use a little bit of common
sense when we draw the graphs.

647
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,710
These are just the
additional bits of help

648
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,850
that we have from calculus.

649
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:25,410
In drawing pictures.

650
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,650
So I'm going to go
through one example

651
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,190
to introduce all the notations.

652
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:42,210
And then eventually, so probably
at the beginning of next time,

653
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,340
I'll give you a
systematic strategy

654
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,600
that's going to work when
what I'm describing now

655
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,360
goes wrong, or a
little bit wrong.

656
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,730
So let's begin with a
straightforward example.

657
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,280
So, the first example that I'll
give you is the function f(x) =

658
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,690
3x - x^3.

659
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,130
Just, as I said, to be able to
introduce all the notations.

660
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:17,640
Now, if you differentiate
it, you get 3 - 3x^2.

661
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,884
And I can factor that.

662
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:21,800
This is 3 (1-x) (1+x).

663
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,750
OK?

664
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:33,140
And so, I can decide
whether the derivative

665
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,390
is positive or negative.

666
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,830
Easily enough.

667
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:50,120
Namely, just staring at this,
I can see that when -1 < x < 1,

668
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,550
in that range there, both these
numbers, both these factors,

669
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,550
are positive.

670
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,290
1-x is a positive number and
1 1+x is a positive number.

671
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:04,710
So, in this range,
f'(x) is positive.

672
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,700
So this thing is,
so f is increasing.

673
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,310
And similarly, in
the other ranges,

674
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,770
if x is very, very
large, this becomes,

675
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,190
if it crosses 1, in
fact, this becomes,

676
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,310
this factor becomes negative
and this one stays positive.

677
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:29,680
So when x > 1, we have
that f'(x) is negative.

678
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,510
And so f is decreasing.

679
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,540
And the same thing goes
for the other side.

680
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,500
When it's less than -1,
that also works this way.

681
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,420
Because when it's less than
-1, this factor is positive.

682
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,300
But the other one is negative.

683
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:56,290
So in both of these cases,
we get that it's decreasing.

684
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:07,300
So now, here's the schematic
picture of this function.

685
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,950
So here's -1, here's 1.

686
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:19,840
It's going to go down, up, down.

687
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,590
That's what it's doing.

688
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,710
Maybe I'll just leave
it alone like this.

689
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,120
That's what it looks like.

690
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,400
So, this is the
kind of information

691
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,980
we can get right off the bat.

692
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,089
And you notice immediately
that it's very important,

693
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:39,880
from the features of
the function, the sort

694
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,060
of key features of the
function that we see here,

695
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,690
are these two places.

696
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,270
Maybe I'll even mark
them in a, like this.

697
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:59,090
And these things
are turning points.

698
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,430
So what are they?

699
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,920
Well, they're just
the points where

700
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,749
the derivative changes sign.

701
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,790
Where it's negative here
and it's positive there,

702
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,850
so there it must be 0.

703
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,830
So we have a definition, and
this is the most important

704
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:21,110
definition in this subject,
which is that is if f'(x_0) =

705
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:33,370
0, we call x_0 a critical point.

706
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,620
The word 'turning point' is not
used just because, in fact, it

707
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,880
doesn't have to turn
around at those points.

708
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,710
But certainly, if it turns
around then this will happen.

709
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,980
And we also have
another notation,

710
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,580
which is the number
y_0 which is f(x_0) is

711
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:59,100
called a critical value.

712
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,230
So these are the key
numbers that we're

713
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,340
going to have to work out
in order to understand

714
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:18,750
what the function looks like.

715
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:27,990
So what I'm going to
do is just plot them.

716
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,440
We're going to plot the
critical points and the values.

717
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,650
Well, we found the critical
points relatively easily.

718
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,240
I didn't write it down here
but it's pretty obvious.

719
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,353
If you set f(x) = 0,
that implies that (1 -

720
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:50,570
x)(1 + x) = 0, which implies
that x is plus or minus 1.

721
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,710
So those are known as
the critical points.

722
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,420
And now, in order to get
the critical values here,

723
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:02,280
I have to plug in f(1), for
instance, the function is 3x -

724
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,480
x^2, so there's this 3
* 1 - 1^3, which is 2.

725
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:17,180
And f(-1), which is 3(-1)
- (-1)^3, which is -2.

726
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,780
And so I can plot
the function here.

727
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,160
So here's the point -1
and here's, up here, is 2.

728
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,620
So this is-- whoops,
which one is it?

729
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,160
Yeah.

730
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,560
This is -1, so it's down here.

731
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,160
So it's (-1, -2).

732
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,570
And then over here, I
have the point (1, 2).

733
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,570
Alright, now, what
information do

734
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,930
I get from - so I've now
plotted two, I claim,

735
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,630
very interesting points.

736
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,000
What information
do I get from this?

737
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,680
The answer is, I know
something very nearby.

738
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,830
Because I've already
checked that the thing

739
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,770
is coming down from the
left, and coming back up.

740
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,370
And so it must be
shaped like this.

741
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,330
Over here.

742
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,620
The tangent line is 0, it's
going to be level there.

743
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,490
And similarly over here,
it's going to do that.

744
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:22,211
So this is what we know so far,
based on what we've computed.

745
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:22,710
Question.

746
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:36,916
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

747
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:37,416
PROF.

748
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,150
JERISON: The question
is, what happens

749
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,233
if there's a sharp corner.

750
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:43,350
The answer is,
calculus is-- it's not

751
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,050
called a critical point.

752
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,090
It's a something else.

753
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,440
And it's a very
important point, too.

754
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,570
And we will be discussing
those kinds of points.

755
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,540
There are much more
dramatic instances of that.

756
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,640
That's part of what
we're going to say.

757
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,670
But I just want to
save that, all right.

758
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,490
We will be discussing.

759
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,010
Yeah.

760
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,540
Question.

761
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,516
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.

762
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,316
JERISON: The question
that was asked

763
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:12,070
was, how did I know
at the critical point

764
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:17,190
that it's concave down over
here and concave up over here.

765
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,590
The answer is that
I actually did not

766
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,300
use the second derivative yet.

767
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,510
What I used is another
piece of information.

768
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,760
I used the information
that I derived over here.

769
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,500
That f' is positive,
where f' is positive

770
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,670
and where it's negative.

771
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,980
So what I know is that
the graph is going down

772
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,470
to the left of -1.

773
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,530
It's going up to
the right, here.

774
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,920
It's going up here and
it's going down there.

775
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,060
I did not use the
second derivative.

776
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,960
I used the first derivative.

777
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,840
OK, but I didn't
just use the fact

778
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,834
that there was a
turning point here.

779
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:57,250
So, actually, I
was using the fact

780
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,416
that it was a turning point.

781
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:01,080
I wasn't using the fact that
it had the second derivative,

782
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,730
though.

783
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,230
OK.

784
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,120
For now.

785
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,500
You can also see it by the
second derivative as well.

786
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,710
So now, the next thing
that I'd like to do,

787
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,170
I need to finish off this graph.

788
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,950
And I just want to do it a
little bit carefully here.

789
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,710
In the order that is reasonable.

790
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,830
Now, you might happen
to notice, and there's

791
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:31,660
nothing wrong with this.

792
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,826
So let's even fill in a guess.

793
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:36,700
In order to fill in a
guess, though, and have

794
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,190
it be even vaguely
right, I do have

795
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,606
to notice that
this thing crosses,

796
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:41,800
this function
crosses the origin.

797
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,120
The function f(x) = 3x -
x^3 happens to also have

798
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,780
the property that f(0) = 0.

799
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,560
Again, common sense.

800
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,590
You're allowed to use
your common sense.

801
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,320
You're allowed to notice a value
of the function and put it in.

802
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,270
So there's nothing
wrong with that.

803
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,960
If you happen to
have such a value.

804
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,650
So, now we can guess what our
function is going to look like.

805
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,010
It's going to maybe
come down like this.

806
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,670
Come up like this.

807
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,130
And come down like this.

808
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,230
That could be what
it looks like.

809
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,800
But, you know,
another possibility

810
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,820
is it sort of comes along
here and goes out that way.

811
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,260
Comes along here and goes
out that way, who knows?

812
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,070
It happens, by the way,
that it's an odd function.

813
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:25,570
Right?

814
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,640
Those are all odd powers.

815
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,710
So, actually, it's
symmetric on the right half

816
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,860
and the left half.

817
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,289
And crosses at 0.

818
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,830
So everything that
we do on the right

819
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,996
is going to be the same as
what happens on the left.

820
00:46:34,996 --> 00:46:36,620
That's another piece
of common sense.

821
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,120
You want to make
use of that as much

822
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,060
as possible, whenever
you're drawing anything.

823
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,340
Don't want to throw
out information.

824
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,540
So this function
happens to be odd.

825
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,700
Odd, and f(0) = 0.

826
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,520
I'm considering those to be
kinds of precalculus skills

827
00:46:52,520 --> 00:47:00,610
that I want you to use
as much as you can.

828
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,880
So now, here's the
first feature which

829
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,880
is unfortunately ignored in
most discussions of functions.

830
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,340
And it's strange,
because nowadays we

831
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,380
have graphing things.

832
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:19,080
And it's really the only
part of the exercise

833
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,480
that you couldn't do, at least
on this relatively simpleminded

834
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,180
level, with a
graphing calculator.

835
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,790
And that is what I would
call the ends of the problem.

836
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,000
So what happens off the
screen, is the question.

837
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,880
And that basically is the
theoretical part of the problem

838
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,430
that you have to address.

839
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,920
You can program this.

840
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,410
You can draw all the
pictures that you want.

841
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,190
But what you won't see
is what's off the screen.

842
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,260
You need to know
something to figure out

843
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,780
what's off the screen.

844
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,560
So, in this case, I'm talking
about what's off the screen

845
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:01,930
going to the right,
or going to the left.

846
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:06,100
So let's check the ends.

847
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,680
So here, let's just take a look.

848
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,280
We have the function f(x),
which is, sorry, 3x - x^3.

849
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,620
Again this is a
precalculus sort of thing.

850
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,230
And we're imagining
now, let's just

851
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,360
do x goes to plus infinity.

852
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,670
So what happens here.

853
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:25,460
When x is gigantic, this term
is completely negligible.

854
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,480
And it just behaves like -x^3,
which goes to minus infinity

855
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,600
as x goes to plus infinity.

856
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:40,330
And similarly, f(x)
goes to plus infinity

857
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,150
if x goes to minus infinity.

858
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,060
Now let me pull down this
picture again, and show you

859
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,140
what piece of the
information we've got.

860
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,610
We now know that it is
heading up this way.

861
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,560
It doesn't go like this,
it goes up like that.

862
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,220
And I'm going to
put an arrow for it,

863
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,580
And it's going down like this.

864
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:06,500
Heading down to minus
infinity as x goes out farther

865
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,310
to the right.

866
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:15,120
And going out to plus infinity
as x goes farther to the left.

867
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,070
So now there's
hardly anything left

868
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,910
of this function to describe.

869
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:27,120
There's really nothing left
except maybe decoration.

870
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,650
And we kind of like
that decoration,

871
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,560
so we will pay attention to it.

872
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,580
And to do that, we'll have to
check the second derivative.

873
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:40,150
So if we differentiate a second
time, the first derivative was,

874
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,680
remember, 3 - 3x^2.

875
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:53,540
So the second derivative is -6x.

876
00:49:53,540 --> 00:50:02,470
So now we notice that f''(x)
is negative if x is positive.

877
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:08,310
And f''(x) is positive
if x is negative.

878
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:13,170
And so in this part
it's concave down.

879
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:18,990
And in this part
it's concave up.

880
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,390
And now I'm going to switch the
boards so that you'll, and draw

881
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,860
it.

882
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,630
And you see that it was
begging to be this way.

883
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,960
So we'll fill in
the rest of it here.

884
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,560
Maybe in a nice color here.

885
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,100
So this is the whole graph
and this is the correct graph.

886
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,450
It comes down in one swoop
down here, and comes up here.

887
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,620
And then it changes to concave
down right at the origin.

888
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,250
So this point is of
interest, not only

889
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,750
because it's the place
where it crosses the axis,

890
00:50:51,750 --> 00:51:00,690
but it's also what's
called an inflection point.

891
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,970
Inflection point,
that's a point where--

892
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,620
because f'' at that
place is equal to 0.

893
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,970
So it's a place where the
second derivative is 0.

894
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:15,160
We also consider those
to be interesting points.

895
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,010
Now, so let me just making
one closing remark here.

896
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:26,590
Which is that all of this
information fits together.

897
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,610
And we're going to have much,
much harder examples of this

898
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,570
where you'll actually have to
think about what's going on.

899
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,190
But there's a lot of
stuff protecting you.

900
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,050
And functions will
behave themselves

901
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,920
and turn around appropriately.

902
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,473
Anyway, we'll talk
about it next time.
