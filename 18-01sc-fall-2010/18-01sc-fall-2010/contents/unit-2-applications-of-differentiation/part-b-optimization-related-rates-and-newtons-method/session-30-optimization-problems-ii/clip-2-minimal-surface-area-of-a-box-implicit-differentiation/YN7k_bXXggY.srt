8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,390
PROFESSOR: In the
twelfth lecture,

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,110
we're going to talk
about maxima and minima.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,110
Let's finish up what
we did last time.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,710
We really only just started
with maxima and minima.

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,100
And then we're going to
talk about related rates.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:48,180
So, right now I want to
give you some examples

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,430
of max-min problems.

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,540
And we're going to start
with a fairly basic one.

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,540
So what's the thing
about max-min problems?

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,240
The main thing is
that we're asking

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,560
you to do a little bit more
of the interpretation of word

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,060
problems.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,970
So many of the problems are
expressed in terms of words.

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:18,650
And so, in this case, we have
a wire which is length 1.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:29,610
Cut into two pieces.

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:38,150
And then each piece
encloses a square.

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,400
Sorry, encloses a square.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,170
And the problem - so
this is the setup.

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:02:02,650
And the problem is to find
the largest area enclosed.

27
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,910
So here's the problem.

28
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:10,340
Now, in all of these
cases, in all these cases,

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,600
there's a bunch of words.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,599
And your job is typically
to draw a diagram.

31
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,890
So the first thing you want
to do is to draw a diagram.

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,340
In this case, it can
be fairly schematic.

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Here's your unit length.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,440
And when you draw
the diagram, you're

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,370
going to have to pick variables.

36
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,700
So those are really
the two main tasks.

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,665
To set up the problem.

38
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,170
So you're drawing a diagram.

39
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,860
This is like word problems
of old, in grade school

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,410
through high school.

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:50,020
Draw a diagram and
name the variables.

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,900
So we'll be doing a
lot of that today.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,950
So here's my unit length.

44
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,160
And I'm going to
choose the variable x

45
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,280
to be the length of one
of the pieces of wire.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,240
And that makes the
other piece 1 - x.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,579
And that's pretty much
the whole diagram,

48
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,870
except that there's something
that we did with the wire

49
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,710
after we cut it in half.

50
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,370
Namely, we built two
little boxes out of it.

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,520
Like this, these
are our squares.

52
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,900
And their side lengths
are x/4 and (1-x)/4.

53
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,710
So, so far, so good.

54
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,880
And now we have
to think, well, we

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,450
want to find the largest area.

56
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,050
So I need a formula for
area in terms of variables

57
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,490
that I've described.

58
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,790
And so that's the last thing.

59
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll give the letter A as
the label for the area.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,760
And then the area is
just the square of x/4

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,805
plus the square of 1 minus x
- whoops, that strange 2 got

62
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:57,780
in here - over 4.

63
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,110
So far, so good.

64
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,750
Now, the instinct
that you'll have,

65
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,020
and I'm going to yield
to that instinct,

66
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,370
is we should charge ahead
and just differentiate.

67
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:07,870
All right?

68
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,578
That's all right.

69
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:10,430
We'll find the critical points.

70
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,995
So we know that those
are important points.

71
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:17,840
So we're going to find
the critical points.

72
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,460
In other words, we
take the derivative,

73
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:27,390
we set the derivative of
A with respect to x = 0.

74
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,020
So if I do that differentiation,
I get the, well,

75
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,240
so the first one,
x^2 / 16, that's 8.

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,870
Sorry.

77
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,060
That's x/8, right?

78
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,570
That's the derivative of this.

79
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,290
And if I differentiate this, I
get well, the derivative of 1 -

80
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,930
x^2 is 2(1-x)(a-1).

81
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,620
So it's -(1-x)/8.

82
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,010
So there are two
minus signs in there,

83
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll let you ponder that
differentiation, which

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,900
I did by the chain rule.

85
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,730
Hang on a sec, OK?

86
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,960
Just wait until we're done.

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,480
So here's the derivative.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,890
Is there a problem?

89
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:29,060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

90
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,320
PROFESSOR: Right, so
there's a 1/16 here.

91
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,850
This is x^2 / 16.

92
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,870
And so it's 2x over
8, over 16, sorry.

93
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,360
Which has an 8.

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,790
That's OK.

95
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:56,080
All right, so now, This is equal
to 0 if and only if x = 1 - x.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,170
That's 2x = 1, or in
other words x = 1/2.

97
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,280
All right?

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,530
So there's our critical point.

99
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,710
So x = 1/2 is the
critical point.

100
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,640
And the critical
value, which is what

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:26,260
you get when you evaluate A at
1/2, is (1/2) / 4, that's 1/8.

102
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:38,030
So that's (1/8)^2 +
(1/8)^2 which is 1/32.

103
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:45,480
So, so far, so good.

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,050
But we're not done yet.

105
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:56,850
We're not done.

106
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,070
So why aren't we done?

107
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,590
Because we haven't
checked the end points.

108
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,370
So let's check the end points.

109
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,450
Now, in this problem,
the end points

110
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,650
are really sort of excluded.

111
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,530
The ends are between
0 and 1 here.

112
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,740
That's the possible
lengths of the cut.

113
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,410
And so what we should really
be doing is evaluating

114
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,230
in the limit, so that would be
the right-hand limit as x goes

115
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,780
to 0 of A. And if
you plug in x = 0,

116
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:42,000
what you get here is 0 +
(1/4)^2, which is 1/16.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,710
And similarly, at the other
end, that's 1-, from the left,

118
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,650
we get (1/4)^2 + 0,
which is also 1/16.

119
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,750
So, what you see is that
the schematic picture

120
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,090
of this function, and
this isn't even so far

121
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,100
off from being the
right picture here,

122
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,120
is that its level here
is 1/16 and then it

123
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,520
dips down and goes up.

124
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,020
Right?

125
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,960
This is 1/2, this is 1, and
this level here is a half that.

126
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,070
This is 1/32.

127
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,900
So we did not
find, when we found

128
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,740
the critical point we did not
find the largest area enclosed.

129
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,060
We found the least
area enclosed.

130
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,850
So if you don't pay attention
to what the function looks like,

131
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,240
not only will you about half
the time get the wrong answer,

132
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,980
you'll get the
absolute worst answer.

133
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,770
You'll get the one which is
the polar opposite from what

134
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,680
you want.

135
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,250
So you have to pay a little bit
of attention to the function

136
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,440
that you've got.

137
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,530
And in this case it's
just very schematic.

138
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,320
It dips down and
goes up, and that's

139
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,514
true of pretty much
most functions.

140
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:00,430
They're fairly simple.

141
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,096
They maybe only have
one critical point.

142
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,550
They only turn around once.

143
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,310
But then, maybe the critical
point is the maximum

144
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,760
or maybe it's the minimum.

145
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,670
Or maybe it's neither, in fact.

146
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,820
So we'll be discussing
that maybe some other time.

147
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:26,260
So what we find here is that
we have the least area enclosed

148
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,420
is 1/32.

149
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,880
And this is true when x = 1/2.

150
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:44,190
So these are equal squares.

151
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:55,970
And most when there's
only one square.

152
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,480
Which is more or less
the limiting situation,

153
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,490
if one of the pieces disappears.

154
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,840
Now, so that's the
first kind of example.

155
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,560
And I just want to make one
more comment about terminology

156
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,600
before we go on.

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,690
And I will introduce it
with the following question.

158
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:31,510
What is the minimum?

159
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:39,620
So, what is the minimum?

160
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,120
Yeah.

161
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,032
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

162
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:44,740
PROFESSOR: Right.

163
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,640
The lowest value
of the function.

164
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,600
So the answer to that
question is 1/32.

165
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,830
Now, the problem with
this question and you

166
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:07,100
will-- so that refers
to the minimum value.

167
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,900
But then there's
this other question

168
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,950
which is where is the minimum.

169
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:22,390
And the answer to
that is x = 1/2.

170
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:30,310
So one of them is
the minimum point,

171
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,640
and the other one is
the minimum value.

172
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,840
So they're two separate things.

173
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,210
Now, the problem is
that people are sloppy.

174
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,550
And especially since you
usually find the critical point

175
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,620
first, and the value,
that is plugging in for A,

176
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,430
second, people will
stop short and they'll

177
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,010
give the wrong answer to
the question, for instance.

178
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,760
Now, both questions are
important to answer.

179
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,040
You just need to have
a word to put there.

180
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,490
So this is a little
bit careless.

181
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,060
When we say what is the minimum,
some people will say 1/2.

182
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,030
And that's literally wrong.

183
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,800
They know what they mean.

184
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,890
But it's just wrong.

185
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,520
And when people ask this
question, they're being sloppy.

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,210
Anyway.

187
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,010
They should maybe
be a little clearer

188
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,850
and say what's
the minimum value.

189
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,320
Or, where is the value achieved.

190
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,080
It's achieved at, or where is
the minimum value achieved.

191
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,970
"Where is min achieved?", would
be a better way of phrasing

192
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,050
this second question.

193
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,900
So that it has an
unambiguous answer.

194
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,670
And when people ask you
for the minimum point,

195
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,490
they're also-- so why is it that
we call it the minimum point?

196
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,510
We have this word, critical
point, which is what x = 1/2

197
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,330
is, and critical value.

198
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,840
And so I'm making those
same distinctions here.

199
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,680
But there's another
notion of a minimum point,

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:09,340
and this is an
alternative if you like.

201
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:19,540
The minimum point is
the point (1/2, 1/32).

202
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,350
Right, that's a
point on the graph.

203
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,490
It's the point - well, so
that graph is way up there,

204
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,740
but I'll just put it on there.

205
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,780
That's this point.

206
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,792
And you might say min there.

207
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,166
And you might point to this
point, and you might say max.

208
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,540
And similarly, this
one might be a max.

209
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,840
So in other words,
what this means

210
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,375
is simply that people
are a little sloppy.

211
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,750
And sometimes they
mean one thing

212
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,770
and sometimes they mean another.

213
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,470
And you're just stuck with
this, because there'll

214
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,200
be some authors who
will say one thing

215
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,575
and some people
will mean another

216
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,770
and you just have to live with
this little bit of annoying

217
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,150
ambiguity.

218
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,690
Yeah?

219
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

220
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,735
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
a good - very good.

221
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,710
So here we go, find the
largest area enclosed.

222
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:22,290
So that's sort of a
trick question, isn't it?

223
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,410
So there are various -
that's a good thing to ask.

224
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,530
That's sort of a
trick question, why?

225
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,840
Because according
to the rules, we're

226
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,280
trapped between the
two maxima at something

227
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,320
which is strictly below.

228
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,140
So in other words, one answer
to this question would be,

229
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,000
and this is the answer that I
would probably give, is 1/16.

230
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
But that's not really true.

231
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,560
Because that's
only in the limit.

232
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,346
As x goes to 0, or
as x goes to 1-.

233
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:02,720
And if you like,
the most is when

234
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,830
you've only got one square.

235
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,550
Which breaks the
rules of the problem.

236
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,290
So, essentially, it's
a trick question.

237
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,670
But I would answer it this way.

238
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,220
Because that's the most
interesting part of the answer,

239
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,780
which is that it's 1/16
and it occurs really

240
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:28,920
when one of the squares
disappears to nothing.

241
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,180
So now, let's do
another example here.

242
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,450
And I just want to
illustrate the second style,

243
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,980
or the second type of question.

244
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,480
Yeah.

245
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:51,750
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

246
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,320
PROFESSOR: The question
is, since the question was,

247
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,090
what was the largest area, why
did we find the least area.

248
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,050
The reason is that when we go
about our procedure of looking

249
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:10,116
for the least, or the most,
we'll automatically find both.

250
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:12,490
Because we don't know which
one is which until we compare

251
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,730
values.

252
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,170
And actually, it's much
more to your advantage

253
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,540
to figure out both the
maximum and minimum

254
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,316
whenever you answer
such a question.

255
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,440
Because otherwise you won't
understand the behavior

256
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,590
of the function very well.

257
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,850
So, the question.

258
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,500
We started out with one
question, we answered both.

259
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,750
We answered two questions.

260
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,480
We answered the question of what
the largest and the smallest

261
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,290
value was.

262
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,505
STUDENT: Also, I'm
wondering if you

263
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:42,680
can check both the minimum
[INAUDIBLE] approaches

264
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,505
[INAUDIBLE].

265
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:48,130
PROFESSOR: Yes.

266
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,880
One can also use-- the
question is, can we

267
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,490
use the second derivative test.

268
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,480
And the answer is, yes we can.

269
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,610
In fact, you can actually
also stare at this

270
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,590
and see that it's
a sum of squares.

271
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,850
So it's always curving up.

272
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,710
It's a parabola with a
positive second coefficient.

273
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,670
So you can differentiate
this twice.

274
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,670
If you do you'll get
1/8 plus another 1/8

275
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,450
and you'll get 1/16.

276
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,540
So the second
derivative is 1/16.

277
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,730
Is 1/4.

278
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,444
And that's an acceptable
way of figuring it out.

279
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:23,360
I'll mention the second
derivative test again,

280
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,950
in this second example.

281
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:32,580
So let me talk about
a second example.

282
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,070
So again, this is going
to be another question.

283
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

284
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,660
PROFESSOR: The question is,
when I say minimum or maximum

285
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,880
point which will I mean.

286
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

287
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,100
PROFESSOR: So I just
repeated the question.

288
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,650
So the question is, when
I say minimum point,

289
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,580
what will I mean?

290
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,100
OK?

291
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,490
And the answer is that for
the purposes of this class

292
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,090
I will probably
avoid saying that.

293
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,340
But I will say, probably,
where is the minimum achieved.

294
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,680
Just in order to avoid that.

295
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,980
If I actually said it, I often
am referring to the graph,

296
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,300
and I mean this.

297
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,280
And in fact, when you
get your little review

298
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,090
for the second exam,
I'll say exactly

299
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,860
that on the review sheet.

300
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,700
And I'll make this very clear
when we were doing this.

301
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
However, I just want to
prepare you for the fact

302
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,480
that in real life, and even me
when I'm talking colloquially,

303
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,750
when I say what's the
minimum point of something,

304
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:48,730
I might actually be mixing it
up with this other notion here.

305
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,380
So let's do another example.

306
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,440
So this is an example
to get us used

307
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,880
to the notion of constraints.

308
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:08,250
So we have, so consider
a box without a top.

309
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:16,860
Or, if you like, we're going
to find the box without a top.

310
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:35,380
With least surface area
for a fixed volume.

311
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,950
Find the box without
a top with least

312
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,360
surface area for a fixed volume.

313
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,940
The procedure for working
this out is the following.

314
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,480
You make this diagram.

315
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,220
And you set up the variables.

316
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,390
In this case, we're going to
have four names of variables.

317
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,890
We have four letters
that we have to choose.

318
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,680
And we'll choose them in a kind
of a standard way, alright?

319
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,260
So first I have to tell
you one more thing.

320
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,880
Which is something that we
could calculate separately

321
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,080
but I'm just going to
give it to you in advance.

322
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,746
Which is that it turns
out that the best

323
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:21,420
box has a square bottom.

324
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,710
And that's going to get rid of
one of our variables for us.

325
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,500
So it's got a square bottom, and
so let's draw a picture of it.

326
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:36,860
So here's our box.

327
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,680
Well, that goes down
like this, almost.

328
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:49,620
Maybe I should get it
a little farther down.

329
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,070
So here's our box.

330
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,900
Let's correct that just a bit.

331
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,760
So now, what about the
dimensions of this box?

332
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,050
Well, this is going to be x,
and this is very foreshortened,

333
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,180
but it's also x.

334
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,130
The bottom is x by x,
it's the same dimensions.

335
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,190
And then the vertical
dimension is y.

336
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,750
So far, so good.

337
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,620
Now, I promised you
two more letter names.

338
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,040
I want to compute the volume.

339
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,440
The volume is, the base is
x^2, and the height is y.

340
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,780
So there's the volume.

341
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,870
And then the area, the area
is the area of the bottom,

342
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,940
which is x^2, that's the bottom.

343
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,510
And then there are
the four sides.

344
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,230
And the four sides are
rectangles of dimensions x, y.

345
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,500
So it's 4xy.

346
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,630
So these are the sides.

347
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,680
And remember, there's no top.

348
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,610
So that's our setup.

349
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,670
So now, the difference
between this problem

350
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,230
and the last problem
is that there

351
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,690
are two variables
floating around,

352
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,710
namely x and y, which
are not determined.

353
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:17,670
But there's what's
called a constraint here.

354
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,920
Namely, we've fixed the
relationship between x and y.

355
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:30,880
And so, that means that we
can solve for y in terms of x.

356
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,310
So y = V/x^2.

357
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,660
And then, we can plug that
into the formula for A.

358
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:50,280
So here we have A which
is x^2 + 4x v/x^2.

359
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:01,410
Question.

360
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:14,600
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

361
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,100
PROFESSOR: The
question is, will you

362
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,350
need to know this intuitively?

363
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,849
No.

364
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:20,830
That's something that I
would have to give to you.

365
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,870
I mean, it's actually
true that a lot

366
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,040
of things, the correct answer
is something symmetric.

367
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,240
In this last
problem, the minimum

368
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,100
turned out to be exactly
halfway in between because there

369
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,900
were sort of equal demands
from the two sides.

370
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,480
And similarly,
here, what happens

371
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,130
is if you elongate
one side, you get less

372
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:46,050
- it actually is involved
with a two variable problem.

373
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,440
Namely, if you have a rectangle
and you have a certain amount

374
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,610
of length associated with
it, what's the optimal thing

375
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,720
you can do with that.

376
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,280
But I won't-- in other
words, the optimal rectangle,

377
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,397
the least perimeter rectangle,
turns out to be a square.

378
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:03,230
That's the little
sub-problem that leads you

379
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,960
to this square bottom.

380
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,270
But so that would have been
a separate max-min problem.

381
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,900
Which I'm skipping, because I
want to do this slightly more

382
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,240
interesting one.

383
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,540
So now, here's
our formula for A,

384
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:27,340
and now I want to follow the
same procedure as before.

385
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,320
Namely, we look for
the critical point.

386
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,530
Or points.

387
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,260
So let's take a look.

388
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,020
So again, A is (x^2 + 4v) / x.

389
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:49,800
And A' is 2x - 4v/x^2.

390
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:59,510
So if we set that equal
to 0, we get 2x = 2v/x^2.

391
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,620
So 2x^3.

392
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,270
How did that happen
to change into 2?

393
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,590
Interesting, guess that's wrong.

394
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,950
OK.

395
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:20,480
So this is x^3 2v.

396
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,730
And so x = 2^(1/3) v^(1/3).

397
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:36,230
So this is the critical point.

398
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,040
So we are not done.

399
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,619
Right?

400
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:40,160
We're not done,
because we don't even

401
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,701
know whether this
is going to give us

402
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:44,410
the worst box or the best
box, from this point of view.

403
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,100
The one that uses the most
surface area or the least.

404
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,990
So let's check the
ends, right away.

405
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,030
To see what's happening.

406
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,280
So can somebody tell
me what the ends, what

407
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,060
the end values of x are?

408
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,520
Where does x range from?

409
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,124
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

410
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,040
PROFESSOR: What's the
smallest x can be, yeah.

411
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:16,520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

412
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,400
PROFESSOR: OK, the claim was
that the largest x could be

413
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,040
root A, because somehow there's
this x^2 here and you can't get

414
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,685
any further past than that.

415
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,700
But there's a key feature
here of this problem.

416
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,050
Which is that A is variable.

417
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,390
The only thing that's
fixed in the problem

418
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:47,440
is V. So if V is fixed,
what do you know about x?

419
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,810
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

420
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,160
PROFESSOR: x > 0, yeah.

421
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,060
The lower end
point, that's safe.

422
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,440
Because that has to do
geometrically with the fact

423
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,430
that we don't have any boxes
with negative dimensions.

424
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,360
That would be refused by
the Post Office, definitely.

425
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,190
Over and above the
empty top, which

426
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,510
they wouldn't accept either.

427
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:13,330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

428
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,260
PROFESSOR: It's true that x is
less than square root of V / y.

429
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,250
So that's using
this relationship.

430
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,750
But notice that y = V/x^2.

431
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,060
So 0 to infinity, I
just got a guess there

432
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,080
over here, that's right.

433
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,350
Here's the upper limit.

434
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,750
So this is really
important to realize.

435
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,420
This is most problems.

436
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,340
Most problems, the variable, if
it doesn't have a limitation,

437
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,370
usually just goes
out to infinity.

438
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,790
And infinity is a very
important end for the problem.

439
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:51,516
It's usually an easy
end to the problem, too.

440
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,890
So there's a possibility that
if we push all the way down

441
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,240
to x = 0, we'll
get a better box.

442
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,230
It would be very strange box.

443
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,620
A little bit like our
vanishing enclosure.

444
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,920
And maybe an
infinitely long box,

445
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,840
also very inconvenient one.

446
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,990
Might be the best box.

447
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,390
We'll have to see.

448
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,810
So let's just take a
look at what happens.

449
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:18,740
So we're looking at A, at 0+.

450
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:25,760
And that's x^2 + 4V
/ x with x at 0+.

451
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
So what happens to that?

452
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:35,220
Notice right here, this
is going to infinity.

453
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,500
So this is infinite.

454
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,250
So that turns out
to be a bad box.

455
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,730
Let's take a look
at the other end.

456
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:51,930
So this is x^2 + 4V /
x, x going to infinity.

457
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:59,930
And again, this term here means
that this thing is infinite.

458
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,870
So the shape of this
thing, I'll draw

459
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,000
this tiny little schematic
diagram over here.

460
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,110
The shape of this thing
is like this, right?

461
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,950
And so, when we find that
one turnaround point,

462
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,000
which happened to be at this
strange point 2/3-- sorry,

463
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,440
2^(1/3) V^(1/3), that is
going to be the minimum.

464
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,090
So we've just discovered
that it's the minimum.

465
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,690
Which is just what
we were hoping for.

466
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,200
This is going to
be the optimal box.

467
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,660
Now, since you asked
earlier and since it's worth

468
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,360
checking this as
well, let's also

469
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,740
check an alternative
justification.

470
00:29:51,740 --> 00:30:02,540
So an alternative
to checking ends

471
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:11,540
is the second derivative test.

472
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,200
I do not recommend the
second derivative test.

473
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,230
I try my best, when
I give you problems,

474
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,290
to make it really hard to apply
the second derivative test.

475
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,320
But in this example,
the function

476
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,570
is simple enough so
that it's perfectly OK.

477
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,110
If you take the
derivative here, remember,

478
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:34,760
this was whatever it
was, 2x - 4V / x^2.

479
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:43,610
If I take the second
derivative, it's 2 + 8V / x^3.

480
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,310
And that's positive.

481
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,580
So this thing is concave up.

482
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,180
And that's consistent
with its being--

483
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:59,840
the critical point is a min.

484
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Is a minimum point.

485
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,180
See how I almost said, is a min,
as opposed to minimum point.

486
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,780
So watch out.

487
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,280
Yes.

488
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,235
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

489
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,860
PROFESSOR: You're
one step ahead of me.

490
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,985
The question is, is this
the answer to the question

491
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:20,090
or would we have to give y
and A and so on and so forth.

492
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,120
So, again, this is
something that I

493
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,220
want to emphasize and take
my time with right now.

494
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,800
Because it depends, what
kind of real-life problem

495
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,360
you're answering, what kind
of answer is appropriate.

496
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,010
So, so far we've found
the critical point.

497
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,080
We haven't found
the critical value.

498
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,190
We haven't found the
dimensions of the box.

499
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,400
So we're going to spend a little
bit more time on this, exactly

500
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,920
in order to address
these questions.

501
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,170
So, first of all.

502
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,470
The value of y.

503
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,120
So, so far we have
x = 2^(1/3) V^(1/3).

504
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,170
And certainly if you're
going to build the box,

505
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,410
you also want to know
what the y-value is.

506
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,970
The y-value is going
to be, let's see.

507
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:12,110
Well, it's V / x^2, so that's
V / (2^(1/3) V^(1/3) )^2,

508
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:19,770
which comes out to
be 2^(2/3) V^(1/3).

509
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,580
So there's the y-value.

510
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:29,505
On top of that, we could
figure out the value of A.

511
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,880
So that's also a perfectly
reasonable part of the answer.

512
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,780
Depending on what
one is interested in,

513
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,675
you might care how
much money it's going

514
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:38,200
to cost you to build this box.

515
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,330
This optimal box.

516
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,370
And so you plug in the value of
A. So A, let's see, is up here.

517
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,740
It's x x^2 + 4V/x.

518
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:57,810
So that's going to be (2^(1/3)
V^(1/3) )^2 plus 4V / (2^(1/3)

519
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,310
V^(1/3) ).

520
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,300
And if you work that all out,
what you get turns out to be 3

521
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,170
* 2^(1/3) V^(2/3).

522
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,540
So if you like, one way
of answering this question

523
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:23,160
is these three things.

524
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,490
That would be the minimum point
corresponding to the graph.

525
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,950
That would be the
answer to this question.

526
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,710
But the reason why I'm
carrying it out in such detail

527
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,370
is I want to show you that there
are much more meaningful ways

528
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,150
of answering this question.

529
00:33:37,150 --> 00:34:02,810
So let me explain that.

530
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,290
So let me go through some
more meaningful answers here.

531
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:14,770
The first more meaningful
answer is the following idea.

532
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:29,780
Simply, what are known as
dimensionless variables.

533
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,050
So the first thing that you
notice is the scaling law.

534
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,580
That A / V^(2/3) is the
thing that's a dimensionless

535
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,260
quantity.

536
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,360
That happens to be 3 * 2^(1/3).

537
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,970
So that's one thing.

538
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,470
If you want to
expand the volume,

539
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,220
you'll have to expand the area
by the 2/3 power of the volume.

540
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:55,430
And if you think of the area as
being in, say, square inches,

541
00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:00,000
and the volume of the box
as being in cubic inches,

542
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,360
then you can see that this
is a dimensionless quantity

543
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,070
and you have a
dimensionless number here,

544
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,730
which is a characteristic
independent of what

545
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,310
A and V were.

546
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:15,710
The other dimensionless
quantity is the ratio of x to y.

547
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,640
Or x to y.

548
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,680
So, again, that's inches
divided by inches.

549
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:32,950
And it's 2^(1/3) V^(1/3)
divided by 2^(-2/3) V^(1/3),

550
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,150
which happens to be 2.

551
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,390
So this is actually the
best answer to the question.

552
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,120
And it shows you that
the box is a 2:1 box.

553
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,200
If this is 2 and this is
1, that's the good box.

554
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,630
And that is just the
shape, if you like,

555
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,670
and it's the optimal shape.

556
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,490
And certainly that,
aesthetically, that's

557
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:12,187
the cleanest answer
to the question.

558
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:13,520
There was a question right here.

559
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,020
Yes.

560
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,537
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

561
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:22,620
PROFESSOR: Could you repeat
that, I couldn't hear.

562
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,036
STUDENT: I'm
wondering if you'd be

563
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:29,850
able to get that answer
if you [INAUDIBLE] square.

564
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,350
PROFESSOR: The
question is, could we

565
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,058
have gotten the answer
if we weren't told

566
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,380
that the bottom was square.

567
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,014
The answer is, yes in
18.02 with multivariable.

568
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:41,222
You would have to have three
letters here, an x, a y,

569
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,470
and a z, if you like.

570
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,170
And then you'd have to work
with all three of them.

571
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,890
So I separated out
into one, there's

572
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,550
a separate one variable problem
that you can do for the base.

573
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,510
And then this is a second
one variable problem

574
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,510
for this other thing.

575
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,910
And it's just two consecutive
one variable problems

576
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,170
that solve the
multivariable problem.

577
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,650
Or, as I say in
multivariable calculus,

578
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,740
you can just do it
all in one step.

579
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,240
Yeah?

580
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

581
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,550
PROFESSOR: Why did
I divide x by y,

582
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,830
rather than y by x, or in any?

583
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,320
So, again, what I was aiming for
was dimensionless quantities.

584
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,640
So x and y are measured
in the same units.

585
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,065
And also the
proportions of the box

586
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:34,310
- so that's another word
for this is proportions -

587
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,430
are something that's universal,
independent of the volume

588
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,020
V. It's something you can say
about any box, at any scale.

589
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,040
Whether it be, you
know, something

590
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,781
by Cristo in the Common.

591
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,530
Maybe we'll get in
here to do some fancy--

592
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

593
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,630
PROFESSOR: The proportions
is - with geometric problems

594
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,930
typically, when there's a
scaling to the problem, where

595
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,020
the answer is the same at small
scales and at large scales

596
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,000
- this is capturing that.

597
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,070
So that's why, the ratios
are what's capturing that.

598
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,410
And that's why it's
aesthetically the nicest thing

599
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,860
to ask.

600
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,905
STUDENT: So, what
exactly does the ratio

601
00:38:17,905 --> 00:38:21,639
of the area to the volume
ratio [INAUDIBLE] tell us?

602
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,180
PROFESSOR: Unfortunately,
this number

603
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,490
is a really obscure number.

604
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,006
So the question is
what does this tell us.

605
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,630
The only thing that
I want to emphasize

606
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,800
is what's on the
left-hand side here.

607
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,870
Which is, it's the area to
the 2/3 power over the volume,

608
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:38,550
so it's a dimensionless quantity
that happens to be this.

609
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,700
If you do this, for example, in
general with planar diagrams,

610
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,200
circumference to area
is a bad ratio to take.

611
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,810
What you want to
take is the square

612
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,932
of circumference to area.

613
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,390
Because the square
of circumference

614
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,690
has the same dimensions,
that is, say,

615
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,880
inches squared to area.

616
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,840
Which is in square inches.

617
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,360
So, again, it's these
dimensionless quantities

618
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,440
that you want to cook up.

619
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,810
And those are the ones that
will have universal properties.

620
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,990
The most famous of
these is the circle

621
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,880
that encloses the most
area for its circumference.

622
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,876
And, again, that's only
true if you take the square

623
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:18,880
of the circumference.

624
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,620
You do the units correctly.

625
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,290
Anyway.

626
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,760
So we're here,
we've got a shape.

627
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,560
We've got an answer
to this question.

628
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,940
And I now want to
do this problem.

629
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,267
Well, let's put it this way.

630
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,350
I wanted to do this problem
by a different method.

631
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,430
I think I'll take
the time to do it.

632
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,790
So I want to do this problem
by a slightly different method

633
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,880
here.

634
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:59,160
So, here's Example 2 by
implicit differentiation.

635
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,950
So the same example, but
now I'm going to do it

636
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,720
by implicit differentiation.

637
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,050
Well, I'll tell you the
advantages and disadvantages

638
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,880
to this method here.

639
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:20,130
So the situation is, you
have to start the same way.

640
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,230
So here is the starting
place of the problem.

641
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:34,980
And the goal was the minimum
of A with V constant.

642
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,540
So this was the situation
that we were in.

643
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:45,130
And now, what I want to
do is just differentiate.

644
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,990
The function y is
implicitly a function

645
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:54,550
of x, so I can differentiate
the first expression.

646
00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:00,380
And that yields
0 = 2xy + x^2 y'.

647
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:11,590
So this is giving me my implicit
formula for y', So y' = -2xy /

648
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,080
x^2.

649
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,950
Or in other words, -2y/x.

650
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,990
And then I also have the dA/dx.

651
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,750
Now, you may notice I'm not
using primes quite as much.

652
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,510
Because all of the
variables are varying,

653
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,300
and so here I'm emphasizing
that it's a differentiation

654
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,790
with respect to the variable x.

655
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:48,130
And this becomes 2x + 4y + 4xy'.

656
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,140
So again, this is
using the product rule.

657
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,450
And now I can plug in for what
y' is, which is right above it.

658
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:04,890
So this is 2x + 4y + 4x (-2y/x).

659
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,150
And that's equal to 0.

660
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:24,770
And so let's gather
that together.

661
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,960
So what do we have?

662
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:34,290
We have 2x + 4y, and then,
altogether, this is 8 - 8y,

663
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,550
equals 0.

664
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,600
So that's the same
thing as 2x = 4y.

665
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,100
The - 4y goes to the other side.

666
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:54,420
And so, x/y = 2.

667
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,260
So this, I claim, so you
have to decide for yourself.

668
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,630
But I claim that this is faster.

669
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,350
It's faster, and also
it gets to the heart

670
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,870
of the matter, which is this
scale-invariant proportions.

671
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,360
Which is basically also nicer.

672
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,720
So it gets to the
nicer answer, also.

673
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,970
So those are the
advantages that this has.

674
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,190
So it's faster, and
it gets to this,

675
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,260
I'm going to call it nicer.

676
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:38,640
And the disadvantage
is it did not

677
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:55,620
check whether this critical
point is a max, min,

678
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,540
or neither.

679
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,280
So we didn't quite
finish the problem.

680
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:10,820
But we got to the
answer very fast.

681
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,640
Yeah, question.

682
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,480
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

683
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,437
PROFESSOR: How
would you check it?

684
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:18,270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

685
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,510
PROFESSOR: Well, so it
gives you a candidate.

686
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,390
The answer is-- so the question
is, how would you check it?

687
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,720
The answer is that for
this particular problem,

688
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,300
the only way to do it is
to do something like this.

689
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,480
So in other words, it doesn't
save you that much time.

690
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,730
But with many, many,
examples, you actually

691
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:42,010
can tell immediately that if the
two ends, the thing is, say, 0,

692
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,650
and inside it's positive.

693
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,370
Things like that.

694
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:53,640
So in many, many, cases
this is just as good.

695
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,510
So now I'm going to
change subjects here.

696
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:02,220
But the subject that I'm
going to talk about next

697
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,550
is almost-- is very,
very closely linked.

698
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,850
Namely, I talked about
implicit differentiation.

699
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,770
Now, we're going to
just talk about dealing

700
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,920
with lots of variables.

701
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,360
And rates of change.

702
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,960
So, essentially,
we're going to talk

703
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,680
about the same type of thing.

704
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,470
So, I'm going to tell
you about a subject which

705
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,220
is called related rates.

706
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,980
Which is really
just another excuse

707
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:32,510
for getting used to setting
up variables and equations.

708
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,320
So, here we go.

709
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,000
Related rates.

710
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,970
And I'm going to illustrate
this with one example today, one

711
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,350
tomorrow.

712
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,600
So here's my example for today.

713
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,810
So, again, this is going
to be a police problem.

714
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,630
But this is going to be a
word problem and-- sorry,

715
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,910
I'm don't want to
scare you, no police.

716
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,940
Well, there are police in the
story but they're not present.

717
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:05,070
So, but I'm going to draw it
immediately with the diagram

718
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,410
because I'm going to
save us the trouble.

719
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,580
Although, you know, the point
here is to get from the words

720
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,940
to the diagram.

721
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:21,990
So you have the police, and
they're 30 feet from the road.

722
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,750
And here's the road.

723
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:36,610
And you're coming along,
here, in your, let's see,

724
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,420
in your car going in
this direction here.

725
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,760
And the police have radar.

726
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,490
Which is bouncing
off of your car.

727
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:53,880
And what they read off is
that you're 50 feet away.

728
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,100
They also know that
you're approaching

729
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:12,370
along the line of the radar at
a rate of 80 feet per second.

730
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:19,260
Now, the question
is, are you speeding.

731
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,730
That's the question.

732
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:29,030
So when you're speeding, by
the way, 95 feet per second

733
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,090
is about 65 miles per hour.

734
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:35,890
So that's the threshold here.

735
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:40,080
So what I want to
do now is show you

736
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,860
how you set up a
problem like this.

737
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,150
This distance is 50.

738
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,460
This is 30, and because it's
the distance to a straight line

739
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,030
you know that this
is a right angle.

740
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,580
So we know that this
is a right triangle.

741
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,810
And this is set out to be
a right triangle, which

742
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:00,300
is an easy one, a 3,
4, 5 right triangle

743
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,640
just so that we can do
the computations easily.

744
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,180
So now, the question is,
how do we put the letters in

745
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,970
to make this problem
work, to figure out

746
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,310
what the rate of change is.

747
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,930
So now, let me explain
that right now.

748
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,590
And we will actually do
the computation next time.

749
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,940
So the first thing is, you have
to understand what's changing

750
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,850
and what's not.

751
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,880
And we're going to use
t for time, in seconds.

752
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,210
And now, an important
distance here

753
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,820
is the distance to this
foot of this perpendicular.

754
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,310
So I'm going to name that x.

755
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,710
I'm going to give that letter x.

756
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,480
Now, x is varying.

757
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,359
The reason why I need a letter
for it as opposed to this 40

758
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,150
is that it's going to
have a rate of change

759
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,220
with respect to t.

760
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,520
And, in fact, it's
related to-- the question

761
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:00,432
is whether dx/dt is
faster or slower than 95.

762
00:49:00,432 --> 00:49:01,890
So that's the thing
that's varying.

763
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,010
Now, there's something
else that's varying.

764
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,000
This distance here
is also varying.

765
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,760
So we need a letter for that.

766
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,620
We do not need a
letter for this.

767
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,920
Because it's never changing.

768
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,010
We're assuming the
police are parked.

769
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,382
They're not ready to roar
out and catch you just yet,

770
00:49:17,382 --> 00:49:18,840
and they're certainly
not in motion

771
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,880
when they've got the
radar guns aimed at you.

772
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,110
So you need to know
something about the sociology

773
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,160
and style of police.

774
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,950
So you need to know things
about the real world.

775
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:36,145
Now, the last bit is,
what about this 80 here.

776
00:49:36,145 --> 00:49:37,770
So this is how fast
you're approaching.

777
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,290
Now, that's measured
along the radar gun.

778
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:44,950
I claim that that's d/dt
of this quantity here.

779
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,910
So this is D is also changing.

780
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,200
That's why we needed
a letter for it, too.

781
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,730
So, next time, we'll just
put that all together

782
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,010
and compute dx / dt.
