00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,222
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:10,680
In this video I
want us to practice

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,540
using Newton's Method to find
the solution to an equation.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,589
So what we're going
to do in particular

5
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,130
is we're going to
use Newton's Method

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,360
to approximate a solution
to the following equation,

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,730
2 cosine x equals 3x.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,970
And I'm going to tell
you where to start.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,770
We're going to the have
our initial value, x_0, be

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,980
pi over 6.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,150
And I want you to find x_2.

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,500
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little time

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,470
to work on that, and
then I'll come back

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,270
and I will show
you how I did it.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,920
OK.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,750
Welcome back.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,190
Again, what we're going to
do is use Newton's Method

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,900
to approximate a solution
to this equation.

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,860
And so what I want to
point out first is,

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,620
I want to point
out why pi over 6

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,680
is a reasonable first
value to choose,

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,750
and I want to point out that
this, in fact, has only one

23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,640
solution.

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,290
So what I'm going to do, to
give us a reason for that,

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,200
is I'm going to draw a
rough sketch of two curves

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,990
and show where they intersect.

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,440
And so I want us to notice that
if I were to look at the two

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,660
curves, y equals cosine
x and y equals 3/2 x

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,960
and I draw them on
the same xy-plane,

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,630
that where they intersect
will be where I have solutions

31
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,870
to this equation.

32
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,410
And that's because I just
divide both sides by 2.

33
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,860
Whatever solves this equation
solves the equation, cosine x

34
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,300
equals 3/2 x.

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,860
So let me give you a rough
sketch of those two curves

36
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,290
and we'll see what the
intersections look like.

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,540
So I'm going to do
that right down here.

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,870
OK.

39
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:49,210
So let me, let me first
draw-- make this y equals 1.

40
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,700
Make this y equals minus 1.

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,301
And I'm going to draw cosine x
first, y equals cosine x first,

42
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,550
because I'm most likely to
have a hard time with that,

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,070
and I'll do my x
scale once I'm done.

44
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,740
And so cosine x, y equals cosine
x, looks something like this.

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,480
Maybe not the most
perfect, but again,

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,150
it's kind of a rough sketch.

47
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,680
That's pretty good.

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,860
Something like this.

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,550
So this is y equals cosine x.

50
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,970
And now I want to graph
y equals 3x over 2.

51
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,940
And that goes through
the point (0, 0).

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,130
It also goes through the
point one comma three halves.

53
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,270
Well, this is pi
over 2 right here.

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,730
So 1 is about here, we'll say.

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,740
Because pi over 2 is a little
bigger than one and a half.

56
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,410
So the 1 is about here, One
and a half is about here.

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,480
Or 3/2, if you need
to remind yourself.

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,658
So the line y equals 3/2 x
looks something like this.

59
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,160
So it's fairly
straightforward to see

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,830
that these two curves
intersect at one spot, whatever

61
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,460
this spot is.

62
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,350
OK?

63
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,850
And notice, to the left
they don't intersect.

64
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,267
So we are just looking
for a single solution.

65
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,100
And then the other thing
I want to point out

66
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
is, why is pi over
six potentially

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,680
a good guess to start with?

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,530
Well, the value, this
is the x-value 1,

69
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,040
and this is the x-value 0.

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,050
We know for a fact
that we have to have

71
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,970
this x-value line
between 0 and 1

72
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,520
because of where my point is
at the time that x equal 1,

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm all the way up at
y equals 3/2 up here.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,664
So at least we know
we're between 0 and 1.

75
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,080
And then from there
you could even

76
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,820
try some other values like
pi over 3 and pi over 4

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,890
and put those in and
see how they compared.

78
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,240
But at least, we'll
just say, at least we

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,420
know x is between 0
and 1, and pi over 6

80
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,730
is certainly in that region.

81
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,554
So that's a good
first starting point.

82
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,970
Now I'm going to come over
here and start to do some work.

83
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,570
If we want to
solve the equation,

84
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,540
2 cosine x equals 3x,
what we're really doing

85
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,480
is we're looking for
zeros of this function.

86
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,590
So we find the zeros of
this function, which we

87
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,840
know there's only one of them.

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,160
We find the zero
of this function,

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,430
then we actually have
solved 2 cosine x equals 3x.

90
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,030
So hopefully that
makes sense to you

91
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,113
that we're actually going
to apply Newton's Method

92
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:25,860
to this function.

93
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,318
And so when we apply Newton's
Method, we need the function.

94
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:29,696
We also need to the derivative.

95
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,740
So let me remind
you, to derivative

96
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,790
of this is going to be
negative 2 sine x minus 3.

97
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,290
Right?

98
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,430
The derivative of cosine
x is negative sine x.

99
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,810
And so this is exactly
the derivative.

100
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,870
And then let me remind you
what Newton's Method says.

101
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,860
It says the next x-value is
equal to the previous x-value

102
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,770
minus the fraction of
the function evaluated

103
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,810
at the previous value divided
by the derivative evaluated

104
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,830
at the previous value.

105
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,920
Right?

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,200
So this is the formula you
have for Newton's Method.

107
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,530
So let's see if we can get from
x_0 to x_1 and then x_1 to x_2.

108
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,490
So in our case, we have x_1
equals, well, x_0 is pi over 6.

109
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,690
And then we have
minus the function

110
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,770
evaluated at pi over 6,
and then the derivative

111
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,750
evaluated at pi over 6.

112
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,000
So the function evaluated at
pi over 6-- cosine of pi over 6

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,660
is root 3 over 2.

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,940
So root 3 over 2 times
2-- we get a root 3.

115
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,570
Separate that out.

116
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,470
And then here, pi over
6 times 3 is pi over 2.

117
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,400
So we get a minus pi over 2.

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,630
Sine pi over 6 is 1/2.

119
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,510
So we get negative
2 times 1/2-- we

120
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:48,660
get negative 1 and
then a negative 3.

121
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
And if you simplify
this, you get

122
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,080
that this is approximately
0.564, or around that.

123
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,970
OK?

124
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,970
And now from here, you
would then, for x_2,

125
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,990
you're going to take 0.564
minus these things evaluated

126
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,600
at 0.564.

127
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,400
This ratio, f of 0.564
divided by f prime at 0.564.

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
But I'm not going to do
that because you should

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,890
get somewhere around, depending
on how many decimal places

130
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,630
you kept, you
should get something

131
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,220
around one of these two values.

132
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,300
So you actually get,
after x_0, by x_1,

133
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,770
you have something that is at
least fixed to the first two

134
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,900
decimal places.

135
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,980
And then this third
decimal place, maybe it's

136
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,929
going to be a 4
or a 3 in the end.

137
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,720
But depending on what
value we choose here,

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,850
we might get slightly
different values here based

139
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,830
on the rounding.

140
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,750
So just suffice it
to say, I got x_1.

141
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,320
Your x_2 should
be about the same.

142
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,911
It should be one of these two.

143
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,410
OK.

144
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,749
So let me just remind you
what we were doing here.

145
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,290
We were trying to
use Newton's Method

146
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,830
to find a solution
to an equation

147
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,414
that I had written up here,
this 2 cosine x equals 3x,

148
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:03,830
and I pointed out
a couple things.

149
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,820
I pointed out that finding
a solution to this equation

150
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,140
is the same as finding a
solution to the equation

151
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,640
cosine x equals 3/2 x.

152
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,780
And so I did that as
a graph to sort of see

153
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,510
if I could get an initial
idea of what kind of solution

154
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,410
I was looking for.

155
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,380
And then we just started
using Newton's Method

156
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,580
on a particular function.

157
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,500
And that function was
this side of the equation

158
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,290
minus this side.

159
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,970
Because if 2 cosine
x minus 3x equals 0,

160
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,670
then 2 cosine x equals 3x.

161
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,700
So we had this function over
here, 2 cosine x minus 3x,

162
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,220
and I said I was looking
for zeros of that function.

163
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,500
And that's where
Newton's Method comes in.

164
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,070
So I think that is
where I will stop.
