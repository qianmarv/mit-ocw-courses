1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,820
Welcome back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,150
In this video, I'd like us
to do some basic manipulation

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,710
of some power series that
you saw in the lecture.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,850
So I have four problems here,
and what I'd like us to do,

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,020
is figure out what function
each of these series represents.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,660
Now, you can assume that
the x-values that we

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,050
are going to insert
into this function

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,852
are only x-values that
let the sums converge.

9
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,560
So you don't have to
worry about anything

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,020
to do with convergence
of these sums.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,590
Just assume the sums
converge, that we've

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,030
picked good x-values.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,530
OK?

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,530
And what I'd like you
to have in the end,

15
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,510
for (a), (b), (c), and
(d), is something like,

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,745
this sum is equal to
a specific function.

17
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:49,140
It should not include
a sum anymore.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,680
So why don't you work on those
for a bit, pause the video,

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,550
and when you're done,
restart the video,

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,800
and I'll come back, and show
you how I work with them.

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,360
All right.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,020
Welcome back.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,660
Well, hopefully these were
a little bit fun for you.

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,310
I always liked them,
the first time I

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,726
saw them, to see how one
could manipulate these series.

26
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:14,100
So again, what
we're trying to do

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,540
is figure out what function
these series represent.

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,360
We're assuming convergence.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,980
And we're going to try
and manipulate them

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,790
to look like things
we already know.

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,904
So I'm going to start.

32
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:26,445
I'm just going to go straight
through (a), (b), (c), and (d).

33
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,850
And I'm going to rewrite the
problem each time, because I

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,141
don't want to keep coming back.

35
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:38,550
So (a), we had the sum n equals
0 to infinity, x to the n

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,990
plus 2 over n factorial.

37
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,840
Well, this looks very
close to something we know.

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,060
It looks a lot like the one,
the function e to the x.

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,710
The difference is that e to the
x just has a power x to the n.

40
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,580
But the good news is that
I am really close to that.

41
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,960
What I really have in the
numerator is x to the n times

42
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,450
x squared.

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,260
Because this x to
the n plus 2, I

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,080
can write as x to the
n times x squared.

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,470
So every term has an x squared.

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,890
So as was mentioned
in the lecture,

47
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,970
you can treat this
really like polynomials.

48
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,010
In some way, you
can factor this out.

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,960
So I can rewrite this as-- well,
I'll rewrite it in two steps.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,330
0 to infinity of x squared,
x to the n over n factorial.

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,570
So x squared times x to the
n gives me x to the n plus 2.

52
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,320
Right?

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,990
But I can actually now, because
this belongs to every sum,

54
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,650
I can pull that all
the way out in front.

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,150
Right?

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,070
And if I pull that all
the way out in front,

57
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,090
if I move this out
to the front, I

58
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,500
have an x squared
times this sum.

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,730
Well, what is the sum?

60
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,240
The sum is e to the x.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,970
It's n equals 0 to infinity of
x to the n over n factorial.

62
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,500
That's just e to the x.

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,680
So this function is
x squared e to the x.

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,666
That's what (a) is.

65
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,040
If you were worried
about it, you

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,639
could write e to
the x as a series,

67
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,680
and then you could multiply
through by x squared,

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,020
and see if that's what you get.

69
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,760
But you'll see, that is
indeed how this problem works.

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,650
OK.

71
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,280
Let's look at (b).

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,775
OK, (b) is equal to the sum--
that's a weird summation

73
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:20,390
sign, sorry about that-- (b)
is equal to the sum n equals 2

74
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,530
to infinity of x to the n.

75
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,410
That's what we
wanted to look at.

76
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,970
Well, this looks very close
to the geometric series,

77
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,680
but it's missing some terms.

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,180
Right?

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,990
The geometric series starts
at n equals 0 to infinity.

80
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,300
But the point I
want to make here

81
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,410
is that I can rewrite this
as the geometric series,

82
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,851
and then I can take
away what I've added in.

83
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,350
OK?

84
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,550
So these do not agree right now.

85
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,870
This equals sign
is not true yet.

86
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,990
But what do I notice?

87
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,810
I notice that this one has two
more terms at the beginning

88
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,220
than this one has.

89
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,710
What are those terms?

90
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,380
Those are when n equals
0 and when n equals 1.

91
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,880
Right?

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,650
There's no n equals
0 or n equals 1 here.

93
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,700
The formulas are
exactly the same.

94
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,210
Right?

95
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,200
x to the n, x to the n.

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,700
They both go to infinity, but
one is starting at n equals 2,

97
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,410
and one's starting
at n equals 0.

98
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,620
Again, I want to remind you.

99
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,400
Why did I bother to
write this thing at all?

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Because this is a
function we know.

101
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,180
But this equals sign
is not true right now.

102
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,680
Right?

103
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,760
I have to get rid of
the extra stuff I added.

104
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
What did I add?

105
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,040
I added-- let me
get this as a sum.

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,530
What did I add on?

107
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,540
I added on x to the
zero and x to the first.

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,360
So now I guess I should have
written subtract here, right?

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,570
I should subtract
x to the 0, and I

110
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,714
should subtract x to the first.

111
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,130
I've already said
it once, but I'm

112
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,090
going to, just to make
sure everybody follows,

113
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,436
say it one more time.

114
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:50,900
I now-- I've taken the
summation I started with,

115
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,180
which went from n
equals 2 to infinity.

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,280
I added two more
terms to the sum.

117
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,530
I made it go from 0 to infinity.

118
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,150
So to keep equality,
I subtracted off

119
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,110
the two things I added in.

120
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,230
I subtracted off x to
the 0 and x to the first.

121
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,120
So now, what was the point
of this part of the exercise?

122
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,620
Well, the point is that
I know what this sum is.

123
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,820
That's the geometric series.

124
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,270
That's 1 over 1 minus x.

125
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,810
And this x to the 0, it's minus
1; x to the first, minus x.

126
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,720
So this I broke
up into something

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,490
I knew as a power series,
and then other pieces

128
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,370
that I had added in to make
it look like something I knew.

129
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,709
I had to subtract those off.

130
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:40,500
So that's the idea.

131
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,480
That one, if you wanted to
go on and simplify further,

132
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,490
you could do that.

133
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,230
But I'm willing to
leave it just as is.

134
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,160
'Cause the idea was really
this part up here, and then

135
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,471
translating it down to this.

136
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:53,970
All right.

137
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,500
Let me write (c) again.

138
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,563
The sum n equals
0 to infinity, x

139
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:05,901
to the n over n factorial
plus x to the n.

140
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,400
OK.

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,990
So the sum n equals
0 to infinity,

142
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,780
x to the n over n
factorial plus x to the n.

143
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,400
And the point to
recognize here is, again,

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,940
as Professor Jerison
mentioned, you're

145
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,420
really treating these
almost like polynomials.

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,050
So you're taking a series, and
you're adding these terms up.

147
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,800
But really, what you
can think about this,

148
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,860
is the two separate
series added up.

149
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,770
And so this is the
sum from n equals 0

150
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,540
to infinity of x to the n over
n factorial, which we know,

151
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,560
plus the sum from n
equals 0 to infinity

152
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,340
of x to the n, which we know.

153
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,687
The first one is
just e to the x,

154
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,270
and the second one,
we've been dealing

155
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,387
a lot with these already today,
is just 1 over 1 minus x.

156
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:50,970
So the point I want
to make, is if you

157
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,560
have this convergent
series, you can split it up

158
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,480
into pieces over the sum.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,510
And these two are both
convergent, we know,

160
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,480
separately, and so we
can write what they are.

161
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,226
x to the n over n factorial from
0 to infinity is e to the x,

162
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:12,740
x to the n from n equals 0 to
infinity is 1 over 1 minus x.

163
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,700
So now we just have one more.

164
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:21,180
Let me write that one. (d)
was summation n equals minus 1

165
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,530
to infinity x to the n plus 1.

166
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,530
All right.

167
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,550
This was not meant
to scare you, but it

168
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,730
was meant to test your
understanding of sigma

169
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,100
notation.

170
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,240
So the problem is, we're
starting at n equals minus 1,

171
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,470
but x is starting-- the
exponent on x is at n plus 1.

172
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,900
So I want to write it in
some form that I know.

173
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,062
Well, let's try and get
the subscript to be 0.

174
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:49,020
so what I'm going to do,
is I'm going to change

175
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,330
the name of the subscript.

176
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm going to let it be
m equals 0 to infinity.

177
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,340
OK?

178
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,686
And I want m to count up by
1 just the way n counts up.

179
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:00,560
So notice what I did.

180
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,290
When m equals 0, n
equals negative 1.

181
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,080
That's what we've set
up as the first term.

182
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,850
That means n plus 1 is
equal to 0 when m equals 0.

183
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,280
And since I'm going
up by one every time

184
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,630
in my summation, my
iteration, here that

185
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,980
means that for every m I have,
I just have to take n plus 1

186
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,420
to figure out what m is.

187
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,044
So I should have said
it the other way.

188
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:27,060
For every n I have, I just
have to add 1 to get m.

189
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,560
OK?

190
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,410
So here, if I start at
negative 1, I start here at 0.

191
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,920
The next term here
is 0, n equals 0,

192
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,620
but the next term
here is m equals 1.

193
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,729
The next term here
would be n equals 1,

194
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,520
and the next term here
would be m equals 2.

195
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,510
So they're just off by
1, but they're still

196
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,530
catching every index.

197
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,480
Now, I don't have to
change what's up here.

198
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,100
Because infinity--
if I add 1 to it,

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm still going off to infinity.

200
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,840
So I don't have to
change what's up here.

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,420
But I do want to write the
formula, or the formula I have

202
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,790
inside the sum in terms of m.

203
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,180
But I've already got it.

204
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,340
Because I know m is
always equal to n plus 1,

205
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,916
so I can replace this
n plus 1 by an m.

206
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,290
And now we know
what that one is.

207
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,810
Right?

208
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,670
m equals 0 to infinity
of x to the m.

209
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,040
That's our geometric series.

210
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,490
So it actually, even
though I wrote it

211
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,510
in kind of a funny way,
it was actually just still

212
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,000
the geometric series.

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,430
I just moved the
indices a little bit

214
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,760
to make sure we could
play with those.

215
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,830
So the idea here, the whole
point of this exercise,

216
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,740
just to recognize how
you can manipulate

217
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,520
these series a little
bit, so that if they're

218
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,770
in a form that looks kind
of like one of the functions

219
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,407
you know, you can see if
it actually is, you know,

220
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,490
a product of something
with the function you know,

221
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,870
or the sum of two
functions you know,

222
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,390
or maybe one of the functions
you know is a power series,

223
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,210
and then you have to drop
off a couple of terms.

224
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,930
So they each sort of
demonstrate a different idea

225
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,070
of how you can manipulate these
convergent power series, based

226
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,820
on functions you already know.

227
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,370
So I'll stop there.
