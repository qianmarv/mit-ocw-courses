00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,820
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,870
In this video, I'd like us to do
some basic manipulation of

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,710
some power series that you
saw in the lecture.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,080
So I have four problems here,
and what I'd like us to do, is

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,020
figure out what function each
of these series represents.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,120
Now, you can assume that the
x-values that we are going to

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,120
insert into this function are
only x-values that let the

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,860
sums converge.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,700
So you don't have to worry
about anything to do with

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,280
convergence of these sums. Just
assume the sums converge,

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
that we've picked
good x-values.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,530
OK?

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,350
And what I'd like you to have
in the end, for A, B, C, and

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,650
D, is something like,
this sum is equal

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,745
to a specific function.

17
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:49,140
It should not include
a sum anymore.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,680
So why don't you work on those
for a bit, pause the video,

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,470
and when you're done, restart
the video, and I'll come back,

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,800
and show you how I
work with them.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:04,040

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,360
All right.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,020
Welcome back.

24
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,660
Well, hopefully these were
a little bit fun for you.

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,640
I always liked them, the first
time I saw them, to see how

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,030
one could manipulate
these series.

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,330
So again, what we're trying to
do is figure out what function

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,540
these series represent.

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,360
We're assuming convergence.

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,500
And we're going to try and
manipulate them to look like

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,790
things we already know.

32
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,230
So I'm going to start.

33
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,445
I'm just going to go straight
through, a, b, c, and d.

34
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,850
And I'm going to rewrite the
problem each time, because I

35
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,110
don't want to keep
coming back.

36
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:39,050
So A, we had the sum n equals 0
to infinity, x to the n plus

37
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,990
2 over n factorial.

38
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,840
Well, this looks very close
to something we know.

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,060
It looks a lot like the one,
the function e to the x.

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,890
The difference is that
e to the x just has a

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,710
power x to the n.

42
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,580
But the good news is that I
am really close to that.

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,550
What I really have in the
numerator is x to

44
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,450
the n times x squared.

45
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,160
Because this x to the n plus 2,
I can write as x to the n

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
times x squared.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,470
So every term has
an x squared.

48
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,690
So as was mentioned in the
lecture, you can treat this

49
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,970
really like polynomials.

50
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,010
In some way, you can
factor this out.

51
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,960
So I can rewrite this as--

52
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,960
well, I'll rewrite
it in two steps.

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,330
0 to infinity of x squared, x
to the n over n factorial.

54
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,570
So x squared times x to the n
gives me x to the n plus 2.

55
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,320
Right?

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
But I can actually now, because
this belongs to every

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,930
sum, I can pull that all
the way out in front.

58
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,150
Right?

59
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,580
And if I pull that all the way
out in front, if I move this

60
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,500
out to the front, I have an
x squared times this sum.

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,730
Well, what is the sum?

62
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,240
The sum is e to the x.

63
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,970
It's n equals 0 to infinity of
x to the n over n factorial.

64
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,500
That's just e to the x.

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,680
So this function is x
squared e to the x.

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,690
That's what a is.

67
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,290
If you were worried about it,
you could write e to the x as

68
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,680
a series, and then you could
multiply through by x squared,

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,020
and see if that's
what you get.

70
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,760
But you'll see, that is indeed
how this problem works.

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,650
OK.

72
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:16,090
Let's look at B. OK, B
is equal to the sum--

73
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,690
that's a weird summation sign,
sorry about that--

74
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,530
b is equal to the sum n equals
2 to infinity of x to the n.

75
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,410
That's what we wanted
to look at.

76
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,400
Well, this looks very close to
the geometric series, but it's

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,180
missing some terms. Right?

78
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,990
The geometric series starts
at n equals 0 to infinity.

79
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,370
But the point I want to make
here is that I can rewrite

80
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,830
this as the geometric series,
and then I can take away what

81
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,070
I've added in.

82
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,350
OK?

83
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,550
So these do not agree
right now.

84
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,870
This equals sign is
not true yet.

85
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,990
But what do I notice?

86
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,810
I notice that this one has two
more terms at the beginning

87
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,220
than this one has.

88
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,710
What are those terms?

89
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,590
Those are when n equals
0 and when n equals 1.

90
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:58,880
Right?

91
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,650
There's no n equals 0
or n equals 1 here.

92
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,700
The formulas are exactly
the same.

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,210
Right?

94
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,200
x to the n, x to the n.

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,390
They both go to infinity, but
one is starting at n equals 2,

96
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,410
and one's starting
at n equals 0.

97
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,620
Again, I want to remind you.

98
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,400
Why did I bother to write
this thing at all?

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Because this is a function
we know.

100
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,180
But this equals sign is
not true right now.

101
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,430
Right?

102
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,760
I have to get rid of the
extra stuff I added.

103
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
What did I add?

104
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,120
I added--

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
let me get this as a sum.

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,530
What did I add on?

107
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,400
I added on x to the zero and x
to the first. So now I guess I

108
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,360
should have written subtract
here, right?

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,480
I should subtract x to the 0,
and I should subtract x to the

110
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,940
first.

111
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,040
I've already said it once, but
I'm going to, just to make

112
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,030
sure everybody follows,
say it one more time.

113
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,900
I now, I've taken the summation
I started with,

114
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,180
which went from n equals
2 to infinity.

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,280
I added two more terms
to the sum.

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,530
I made it go from
0 to infinity.

117
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,650
So to keep equality, I
subtracted off the two things

118
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,110
I added in.

119
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,230
I subtracted off x to the
0 and x to the first.

120
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,120
So now, what was the point of
this part of the exercise?

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,620
Well, the point is that I
know what this sum is.

122
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,820
That's the geometric series.

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,270
That's 1 over 1 minus x.

124
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,270

125
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,810
And this x to the 0 minus 1
x to the first minus x.

126
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,990
So this I broke up into
something I knew as a power

127
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,320
series, and then other pieces
that I had added in to make it

128
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,370
look like something I knew.

129
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,810
I had to subtract those off.

130
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,500
So that's the idea.

131
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,640
That one, if you wanted to go
on and simplify further, you

132
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,490
could do that.

133
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,230
But I'm willing to leave
it just as is.

134
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,160
'Cause the idea was really this
part up here, and then

135
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,510
translating it down to this.

136
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,970
All right.

137
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,500
Let me write C again.

138
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,545
The sum n equals 0 to infinity,
x to the n over n

139
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:06,130
factorial plus x to the n.

140
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,400
OK.

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,940
So the sum n equals 0 to
infinity, x to the n over n

142
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,780
factorial plus x to the n.

143
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,570
And the point to recognize here
is, again, as Professor

144
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,950
Jerison mentioned, you're really
treating these almost

145
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,420
like polynomials.

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,340
So you're taking a series, and
you're adding these terms up.

147
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,230
But really, what you can think
about this, is the two

148
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,860
separate series added up.

149
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,250
And so this is the sum from n
equals 0 to infinity of x to

150
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,680
the n over n factorial, which
we know, plus the sum from n

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,340
equals 0 to infinity of x
to the n, which we know.

152
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,850
The first one is just e to the
x, and the second one, we've

153
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,600
been dealing a lot with these
already today, is just 1

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,610
over 1 minus x.

155
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,630
So the point I want to make, is
if you have this convergent

156
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,480
series, you can split it up
into pieces over the sum.

157
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,510
And these two are both
convergent, we know,

158
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,480
separately, and so we can
write what they are.

159
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,070
x to the n over n factorial from
0 to infinity is e to the

160
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,270
x , x to the n from n equals
0 to infinity is 1

161
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,740
over 1 minus x.

162
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,700
So now we just have one more.

163
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,630
Let me write that one.

164
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,750
D was summation n equals
minus 1 to infinity x

165
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,530
to the n plus 1.

166
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,530
All right.

167
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,430
This was not meant to scare you,
but it was meant to test

168
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,100
your understanding of
sigma notation.

169
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,240
So the problem is, we're
starting at n equals minus 1,

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,470
but x is starting, the exponent
on x is at n plus 1.

171
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,900
So I want to write it in
some form that I know.

172
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,120
Well, let's try and get
the subscript to be 0.

173
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
so what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to change the name

174
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,330
of the subscript.

175
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,990
I'm going to let it be m
equals 0 to infinity.

176
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,340
OK?

177
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,760
And I want m to count up by 1
just the way n counts up.

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,560
So notice what I did.

179
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,290
When m equals 0, n equals
negative 1.

180
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,080
That's what we've set up
as the first term.

181
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,850
That means n plus 1 is equal
to 0 when m equals 0.

182
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,870
And since I'm going up by one
every time in my summation, my

183
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,950
iteration, here that that means
that for every m I have,

184
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,420
I just have to take n plus 1
to figure out what m is.

185
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,500
So I should have said
it the other way.

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,260
For every n I have, I just
have to add 1 to get m.

187
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,560
OK?

188
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,410
So here, if I start at negative
1, I start here at 0.

189
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,520
The next term here is 0, n
equals 0, but the next term

190
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,620
here is m equals 1.

191
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,120
The next term here would be n
equals 1, and the next term

192
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,520
here would be m equals 2.

193
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,510
So they're just off by
1, but they're still

194
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,530
catching every index.

195
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,480
Now, I don't have to change
what's up here.

196
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,780
Because infinity--

197
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,880
if I add 1 to it, I'm still
going off to infinity.

198
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,840
So I don't have to change
what's up here.

199
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,420
But I do want to write the
formula, or the formula I have

200
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,790
inside the sum in terms of m.

201
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,180
But I've already got it.

202
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,750
Because I know m is always equal
to n plus 1, so I can

203
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,230
replace this n plus 1 by an m.

204
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,290
And now we know that one is.

205
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,810
Right?

206
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,670
m equals 0 to infinity
of x to the m.

207
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,040
That's our geometric series.

208
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,420
So it actually, even though I
wrote it in kind of a funny

209
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,000
way, it was actually just still
the geometric series.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,100
I just moved the indices a
little bit to make sure we

211
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,760
could play with those.

212
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,020
So the idea here, the whole
point of this exercise, just

213
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,610
to recognize how you can
manipulate these series a

214
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,830
little bit, so that if they're
in a form that looks kind of

215
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,110
like one of the functions you
know, you can see if it

216
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,760
actually is, you know, a product
of something with the

217
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,060
function you know, or the sum of
two functions you know, or

218
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,490
maybe one of the functions you
know is a power series, and

219
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,880
then you have to drop off a
couple of terms. So they each

220
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
sort of demonstrate a different
idea of how you can

221
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,270
manipulate these convergent
power series, based on

222
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,820
functions you already know.

223
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,530
So I'll stop there.

224
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:02,869
