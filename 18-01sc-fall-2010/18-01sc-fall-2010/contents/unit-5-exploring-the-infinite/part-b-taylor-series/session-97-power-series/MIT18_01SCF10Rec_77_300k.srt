00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,800
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to recitation.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,780
In this video I want to finish
up our work with the ratio

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,270
test, and in particular in
this video, I'd like to

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,000
address something
that Professor

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Jerison talked about.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,070
In, when he was talking about
these Taylor series, he was

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,880
talking about the radius of
convergence at some point.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,760
And he didn't go into it very
specifically, but he was

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,620
essentially saying for some
values of x-- you'll have a

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,540
series that has x to the n in
it-- for some values of x it

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,780
will converge, and for some
values it will diverge.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,400
So let me just remind you of
something you already know.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,353
So, if we consider the
series x to the n.

15
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:48,620
Right?

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,990
This is the geometric series and
we know that this is equal

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,880
to 1 over 1 minus x if the
absolute value of x

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,085
is less than 1.

19
00:00:58,085 --> 00:00:59,230
Right?

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,310
And so we know that this
series is finite.

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,400
This sum converges.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,520
To whatever value, If I plug in
x here, it converges when

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,660
absolute value of x
is less than 1.

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,220
And it diverges when absolute
value of x is bigger than 1.

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,830
And we're not going to address
when the absolute

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,250
value of x equals 1.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,550
We won't address that case.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,240
But, the point I want to make
it is that for some values

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,395
this series converges,
and for some

30
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:27,500
values this series diverges.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,680
And those values can give us
the radius of convergence.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,370
So the radius of convergence of
this series is actually 1,

33
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,530
because x goes from 0 up to 1,
and then from 0 down to 1.

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,860
If you think about it, radius
might be a confusing term, but

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,260
can think about it as a circle
and one dimension less than

36
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,820
maybe you usually think
about it as a circle.

37
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,840
If this is the number line,
we're going from 0 up to 1 and

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
down to minus 1.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,020
So you're going in one direction
up to 1 and one

40
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,640
direction down to minus 1.

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,740
So this is radius 1.

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,390
r is equal to 1.

43
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,130
So what I want to do is figure
out how I can use the ratio

44
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,230
test to tell me the radius of
convergence of other series,

45
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,255
other power series,
besides this one.

46
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,320
OK?

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,770
So we're really interested in
for what values of x do these

48
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,760
power series converge.

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,050
OK?

50
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,050
And how we're going to do
that, is we're going to

51
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,390
directly use the ratio test. And
one thing that I mentioned

52
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,440
in the other case, in the other
ratio test video, is I

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,460
said you want to have your
terms be positive.

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,000
And so just to make this easy
on ourselves, when we do the

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,970
ratio test we're just going
to take the absolute

56
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,250
value of the ratio.

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,480
And that will be sufficient for
our purposes to determine

58
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,290
the radius of convergence.

59
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,090
I don't want to go into
anything more

60
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,160
complicated than that.

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,737
So we'll see as we do these
examples, we're just gonna,

62
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:48,010
we're just gonna take the
absolute value of the ratio.

63
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,110
So let's actually start
off right away

64
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,820
with doing some examples.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,590
And each time I do an
example, I'm asking

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,840
the following question.

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,140

68
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,810
Actually, I was going to say
for what values of x, but

69
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,050
that's not quite true.

70
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:13,150
I just want to know what is the
radius of convergence for

71
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,880
each power series?

72
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,450
So I'm not going to write it up
every time, but this is the

73
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,560
question we want to
be thinking about.

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,810
So I'm going to write down some
power series and we're

75
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,020
going to see what
is the radius of

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,680
convergence for each of those.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,800
I was going to write find the
values of x for which the

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,180
power series converge, but
that's not quite true because

79
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,160
sometimes it will actually
converge on one

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
or both of the endpoints.

81
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,650
We're not going to deal
with that one.

82
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,720
But sometimes it will converge
on one or the

83
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,170
other of the endpoints.

84
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,500
So I'm going to be asking the
question, find the radius of

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,820
convergence.

86
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,620
So let's do an example, and I'll
show you how it applies

87
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,900
to the ratio test. Then we'll
go from there and do some

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,460
other examples.

89
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,840
So let's consider the series
x over 2 to the n.

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,870
This will be an easy one.

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,540
Now the ratio test
told us that we

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,900
examine a certain limit.

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,620
We examine the limit as
n goes to infinity.

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,800
It said a sub n plus
1 over a sub n.

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Well if we think of this whole
thing as a sub n, then a sub n

96
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,050
plus 1 is x over 2
to the n plus 1.

97
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,910
And then we have to divide
by x over 2 to the n.

98
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,620
So let me just make sure
we understand that.

99
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,390
The way we, the way we want to
think about this is as if the

100
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,520
a sub n is actually a function
of x that also depends on n.

101
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,640
OK, so a sub n, we think of it
as x over 2 raised to the n.

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,090
So a sub n plus 1 is x over
2 raised to the n plus 1.

103
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,770
a sub n is x over 2
raised to the n.

104
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,530
OK, and so this looks exactly
like the ratio test we had

105
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,870
before, I told you I'm going to
put absolute values on it.

106
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,100
And so let me simplify this.

107
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,510
I put the division sign maybe
kind of funny 'cause I wanted

108
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,520
to have it in a row there.

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,830
I apologize if that made
it more confusing.

110
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,410
So this equals, well I have x to
the n plus 1 over x to the

111
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,370
n times 2 to the n-- this come
to the numerator because it's

112
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,640
in the denominator of
the denominator--

113
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,580
over-- and this goes to
the denominator--

114
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,270
2 to the n plus 1.

115
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,570
Now what is this?

116
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,680
This whole thing converges
to what?

117
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,950
2 to the n over 2 to the n plus
1 simplifies to 1/2, and

118
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,020
x to the n plus 1 over x
the n simplifies to x.

119
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,790
So this is equal to absolute
value of x over 2.

120
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,490
Now we haven't shown how the
ratio test is going to help us

121
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,580
find the radius of
convergence.

122
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,060
And here's where we're going
to see it working.

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,370

124
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,530
If we want to know that, we
want to draw a conclusion

125
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,150
about the convergence
of this series.

126
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,790
We know that if this limit is
less than 1, that the series

127
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,830
definitely converges.

128
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,320
So if I take my limit when I'm
all done, and I set it less

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,030
than 1, and I solve for absolute
value of x, then that

130
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,640
will tell me exactly what the
radius of convergence is.

131
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,070
Let me go through that
one more time.

132
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,560
We knew that if we had this
series in terms of a sub n,

133
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,610
and we looked at the ratio and
we took the limit of these

134
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,450
ratios, and in the limit the
value was will strictly less

135
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,990
than 1, we know the
series converges.

136
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,700
So now we have this thing in
terms of x, but ultimately

137
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,450
it's the same process.

138
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,890
And we get to a place where
we know the limit.

139
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,140
It depends on x.

140
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,310
And so the limit will be less
than 1, exactly where this

141
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,540
thing is less than 1.

142
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,930
Right?

143
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,870
So it's now in terms of x.

144
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,660
This less than 1 I'm putting
in at the end.

145
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,070
This is where the ratio
test is happening.

146
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,620
So what does this tell us?

147
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,980
Where does this converge?

148
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,640
It converges when absolute value
of x over 2 is less than

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,580
1, which means absolute value
of x is less than 2.

150
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,830
Right?

151
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,360

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,640
I just multiply by 2 'cause
absolute value of 2 is 2.

153
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,950
I don't have to worry about
if 2 is negative.

154
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,860
So the absolute value
of x is less than 2.

155
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,820
That tells me the radius of
convergence is actually 2.

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,610
Now this shouldn't surprise
us really.

157
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,550
Because this is, in fact, a
geometric series, and we know

158
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,165
that the usual geometric series
converges when the

159
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,050
absolute value of x
is less than 1.

160
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,780
So it's not surprising, and
actually fits in with what we

161
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,700
already know, that if this thing
on the inside, if its

162
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,510
absolute value is less than 1,
that the thing will converge.

163
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,330
So that that means absolute
value of x has to

164
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,660
be less than 2.

165
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,715
So again, hopefully this fits
in with the knowledge we

166
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,070
already have. Hopefully it makes
sense to you, what we're

167
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,960
trying to do.

168
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,056
And so let's do another couple
of examples to make this, make

169
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,306
this solidify.

170
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,100

171
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,780
All right what were
my other examples?

172
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,250
OK, let's do this one.

173
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,360
x to the n over n factorial.

174
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,806
All right, so now our a sub
n, when we look at this

175
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:08,932
geometric-- geometric? this is
not geometric-- when we look

176
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:13,220
at the series, our a sub
n is going to be x to

177
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,940
the n over n factorial.

178
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,100
And so when we take our whole
limit, the thing that's going

179
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,210
to happen is we're going to have
something in terms of x

180
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,950
at the end.

181
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,320
Our goal is to find for what
values of x is that thing we

182
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,310
have less than 1?

183
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,770
Again this is where we're
using the ratio test.

184
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,340
So let's look at this thing.

185
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,650
We want to look at the limit
as n goes to infinity.

186
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:39,870
Well, a sub n plus 1 is going
to be x to the n plus 1 over

187
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,260
the quantity n plus
1 factorial.

188
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,855
I'm going to put the absolute
value over there.

189
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:48,360
Now I'm going to multiply
it by 1 over a sub n.

190
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,200
So this is actually a sub n, so
1 over that is n factorial

191
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,650
over x to the n.

192
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,960
Now we have to be a little
careful here.

193
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,820
I want to make sure everybody
understands something.

194
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,950
n factorial is n times n minus
1 times n minus 2 times n

195
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,830
minus 3 all the way down.

196
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,930
n plus 1 factorial is n plus 1
times n times n minus 1 times

197
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,440
n minus 2 all the way down.

198
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,630
So n plus 1 factorial--

199
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,450
I'll just write this here-- n
plus 1 factorial equals n plus

200
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,390
1 times n factorial.

201
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,470
That's very important that
you recognize that OK?

202
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,030
Because the division of
factorials is a little more

203
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,890
complicated than the division
of straight polynomials or

204
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,510
something like this.

205
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,410
Alright?

206
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,710
Because when I take this limit,
what am i going to get?

207
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,350
I'm going to get x to the n
plus 1 over x to the n.

208
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,530
That's going to give me 1x.

209
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,760
And then n factorial divided
by n plus 1 factorial, well

210
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,250
based on the fact that this is
equal to n plus 1 times n

211
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,610
factorial, the n factorials
divide, and I'm left with x

212
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,940
over n plus 1.

213
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,480
That's actually what
this limit equals.

214
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,260
Let me go through that
one more time.

215
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,860
This part is easy, x to the
n plus 1 over x to the m

216
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,390
gives me the x.

217
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:14,520
And then n factorial over n
plus 1 factorial is just 1

218
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,570
over n plus 1.

219
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,580
And I have be careful because
I wrote equals, but there's

220
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,490
still an n here.

221
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,390
So let me erase that.

222
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,990
I'm not gonna, I don't think, my
studio audience didn't say

223
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,610
anything yet, but I don't think
they were going to let

224
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,890
me get away with that.

225
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,690
This is a limited as n goes to
infinity of x over n plus 1.

226
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,090
Now what is that?

227
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,260
Well as n goes to infinity,
for any fixed x I pick--

228
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,370
we have to be careful here--
for any fixed x I pick as n

229
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,805
goes to infinity, this quantity
is equal to 0.

230
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:45,140
OK?

231
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,180
If I were moving x around, if
I were moving x with n, this

232
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,020
will be a problem,
but x is fixed.

233
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,580
When I do this sum, I fix
my x at the beginning.

234
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,080
So for any fixed x n plus 1 is
getting arbitrarily large.

235
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,820
So x over n plus 1 is getting
arbitrarily small.

236
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,110
So this limit is 0.

237
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,360
This is strictly less than 1.

238
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
What does this mean?

239
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,587
For any x I pick, this whole
thing is less than 1.

240
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:09,500
Right?

241
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,370
Any fixed x, this ratio
is always less than 1.

242
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,100
What does that mean?

243
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,660
That means the radius of
convergence is infinite.

244
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,860
So the radius is infinity.

245
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,230
OK.

246
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,070
The radius of convergence
is actually infinite.

247
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,530
What series is this?

248
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,150
This is actually the Taylor
series for e to the x.

249
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,540
So we know that the Taylor
series for e to the x that

250
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,926
this converges for any x.

251
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,220
That's a nice thing.

252
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,250
So now we've used the ratio test
to tell us how the Taylor

253
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,590
series behaves for a function
that we know.

254
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,680
OK, we know its radius of
convergence is infinite.

255
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,210
So that's pretty nice.

256
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,240
All right let's do maybe one
or two more examples,

257
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,010
depending on how much
room I have.

258
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,760
OK, let's try this one.

259
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,430
x to the n over n times
2 to the n.

260
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,990
All right, so this is another
power series we have. And we

261
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,695
want to know if I want to plug
in some value of x and I want

262
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:14,970
to take the sum, will that
converge for that particular

263
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,790
value of x?

264
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,620
We want to know what values
of x can I plug in.

265
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,173
All right so again, we're going
to look at the radius

266
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:24,710
of, find the radius of
convergence based on the ratio

267
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:33,190
test. So the n plus first term
is x to the n plus 1 over n

268
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,580
plus 1 2 to the n plus 1.

269
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,760
And then I have to multiply by
the a sub m's, the a sub n

270
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,650
term, or multiply by
1 over that, sorry.

271
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm dividing by a sub n, so
I get n times 2 to the n

272
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,410
over x to the n.

273
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,551
All right, this gives me an x.

274
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:57,200

275
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,910
n plus 1 over n, let me just
write out actually what we get

276
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,340
here, 2 to the n over 2 to the
n plus 1 gives me an over 2.

277
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,710
and then n over n plus 1.

278
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,580
This is positive, so I
don't have to worry

279
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,700
about anything there.

280
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,520
The limit as n goes to infinity
absolute value of x

281
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,680
over 2 times n over n plus
1, what's that equal to?

282
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,040
Well this, as n goes to infinity
is equal to 1, so

283
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,060
it's absolute value
of x over 2.

284
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,510
Let me again remind you
what we are doing.

285
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,760
We're saying I want to know the
radius of convergence for

286
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,530
this series.

287
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,780
So I want to know what radius,
so what values of x can I put

288
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,270
in to make this series
converge?

289
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,530
I might miss the endpoints, but
beyond that what values of

290
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,980
x make this series converge?

291
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,160
So I'm looking at the ratio
test. I took the ratio test, I

292
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,720
got it all the way to a place
where I have something in

293
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,890
terms of x.

294
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,580
As long as that thing is less
than 1, I'm golden.

295
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,060
As long as that thing is less
than 1, the series converges.

296
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,690
So again, I actually get
another thing where the

297
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,030
absolute value of x
is less than 2.

298
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,085
Alright?

299
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,130
I probably should have picked
a different number there.

300
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,390
What do you think would happen
if this was a 7?

301
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,470
Well everything would've been
the same except this would

302
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,740
have been a 7, and the
radius of convergence

303
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,130
would have been 7.

304
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,360
So I should have picked a
different number there, so we

305
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,130
had a different radius of
convergence, but you can see

306
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,230
how that works.

307
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,160
And the, I'm gonna do just, I
have a room, I'm going to do

308
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
one more example.

309
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,970
'Cause this one's a good
one to do also.

310
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,550

311
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,250
OK, I'm actually going to do
another series that we know, x

312
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,450
to the 2n over 2n factorial.

313
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm doing this one for a
particular reason to help us

314
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,480
deal with when some things,
when the exponents and the

315
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,390
factorials get a little
more complicated.

316
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,600
I want to also point out
what series is this.

317
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,810
You should know what
series this is.

318
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,310
And I know, without thinking,
that it's

319
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,520
either sine or cosine.

320
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,460
I guess I should say
it's starting at

321
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,170
n equals 0 to infinity.

322
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,460
And then I might get nervous and
say well, which one is it?

323
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,390
Well what's the first term?

324
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,460
x to the 0 is 1 over
0 factorial is 1.

325
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,160
So it looks like the first term
is 1, so that makes me

326
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,770
know it's cosine.

327
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,950
Right?

328
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,710
If the first term were x
I'd know it was sine.

329
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,250
So if I get nervous, so this,
where it converges, is equal

330
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,770
to cosine x.

331
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,020
Let's look at this one.

332
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,000

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,010
All right, we got, now this you
have to be a little more

334
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,400
careful because it's 2 times the
quantity n plus 1 over 2n

335
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,640
plus 2 factorial.

336
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:41,280
So that's n plus 1 times 2 is
2n plus 2 times 2n factorial

337
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,370
over x to the 2n.

338
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,550
All right this is where it might
get a little tricky.

339
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,890
This is 2n plus 2
divided by 2n.

340
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,480
So this is going to be the limit
as n goes to infinity of

341
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,980
x squared, the absolute value
squared which is just x

342
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,050
squared again, times
this thing.

343
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,100
So let's figure out what
this thing is.

344
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,560
OK?

345
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,790
What is 2n factorial?

346
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,650
I'm going to write out the first
couple terms. OK, that's

347
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,580
going to be 2n times 2n minus
1 times, that's all

348
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,490
the way down to 1.

349
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,150
And then what's this?

350
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:23,210
This is 2n plus 2 times 2n plus
1 times 2n times, all the

351
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,330
way down to 1.

352
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,725
So we see, this is what I was
talking about earlier actually

353
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,820
also, was that I've
added 2 to this.

354
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,280
So it's not surprising I get 2
more terms, and then I'm down

355
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,415
to 2n factorial again.

356
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:35,830
Right?

357
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,520
So this 2n factorial.

358
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,260
This is 2n factorial.

359
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,820
So the 2n factorial here divides
with the 2n factorial

360
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,060
here, and I'm left
with these here.

361
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,370
I get 1 over 2n plus
2 times 2n plus 1.

362
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,860
Now what happens as n
goes to infinity?

363
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,410
Obviously this ratio
goes to 0.

364
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,010
So I'm actually in another case
similar to the one I saw

365
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,910
with e to the x.

366
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,890
Is that this goes to 0.

367
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,040
So the limit is actually
equal to 0, which is

368
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,210
always less than 1.

369
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,670
Any value of x I pick
is less than 1.

370
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,940
And so this series actually
converges for

371
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,850
any x that I pick.

372
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,880
So this is another case where
I have the radius of

373
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,550
convergence is actually
infinite.

374
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,600
OK, so we'll probably give you
some problems where you have

375
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,840
some other things happening.

376
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,470
'Cause you can actually get the
radius convergence is 0.

377
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,000
You can actually get that the
only place it converges is at

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,850
x equals 0.

379
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,960
So you might actually get
the limit as n goes

380
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,530
to infinity is infinity.

381
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,520
I didn't give you an example
of that, but that's a case

382
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,250
where whatever x value you
put in, your limit is

383
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,930
still bigger than 1.

384
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,390
Then you would always get a
diverges, except when x is 0.

385
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,200
OK, so that's another thing
that you can run into.

386
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
But, the point I want to make
is that this is going to let

387
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,030
us determine, you know, at least
the radius over which

388
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,810
these x values converge.

389
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,440
And it also helps us if we know
certain things about a

390
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,590
function to tell us where this
function is actually equal to

391
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,470
the series that we're
dealing with.

392
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,400
So I think that's where I'll
stop, and I hope this was

393
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,650
informative.

394
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,014
