8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,520
PROFESSOR: Last time we
left off with a question

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,185
having to do with
playing with blocks.

10
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:30,450
And this is supposed to give us
a visceral feel for something

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,820
anyway, having to
do with series.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,650
And the question was whether
I could stack these blocks,

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,460
build up a stack so that--
I'm going to try here.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm already off
balance here, see.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,150
The question is
can I build this so

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,350
that the-- let's
draw a picture of it,

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,870
so that the first
block is like this.

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,567
The next block is like this.

19
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,150
And maybe the next
block is like this.

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,240
And notice there
is no visible means

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,410
of support for this block.

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,310
It's completely to the
left of the first block.

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,055
And the question is,
will this fall down?

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:21,610
Or at least, or more precisely,
eventually we'll ask,

25
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,650
you know, how far can we go?

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,760
Now before you
answer this question,

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,900
the claim is that
this is a kind of

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,480
a natural, physical
question, which

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,330
involves some important answer.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,290
No matter whether the answer
is you can do it or you can't.

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,090
So this is a good
kind of math question

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,440
where no matter what the
answer is, when you figure out

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,850
the answer, you're going to
get something interesting out

34
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,350
of it.

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,766
Because they're
two possibilities.

36
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:53,055
Either there is a limit to how
far to the left we can go --

37
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:56,400
in which case that's a
very interesting number --

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,810
or else there is no limit.

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,370
You can go arbitrarily far.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,240
And that's also
interesting and curious.

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,400
And that's the difference
between convergence

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,190
and divergence,
the thing that we

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,380
were talking about up to
now concerning series.

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,890
So my first question
is, do you think

45
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,810
that I can get it so that
this thing doesn't fall down

46
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,020
with-- well you see I have
about eight blocks here or so.

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,570
So you can vote now.

48
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,750
How many in favor
that I can succeed

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,450
in doing this sort of thing with
maybe more than three blocks.

50
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,040
How many in favor?

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,860
All right somebody
is voting twice.

52
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,560
That's good.

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,980
I like that.

54
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,005
How about opposed?

55
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,450
So that was really
close to a tie.

56
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,780
All right.

57
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,029
But I think the there was
slightly more opposed.

58
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:49,570
I don't know.

59
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,000
You guys who are in the
back maybe could tell.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,750
Anyway it was pretty close.

61
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,250
All right.

62
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,117
So now I'm going-- because
this is a real life thing,

63
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:58,200
I'm going to try to do it.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,476
All right?

65
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:00,550
All right.

66
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,240
So now I'm going to tell
you what the trick is.

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,890
The trick is to do it backwards.

68
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,230
When most people are
playing with blocks,

69
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,420
they decide to build
it from the bottom up.

70
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,670
Right?

71
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,280
But we're going to build
it from the top down,

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,581
from the top down.

73
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,080
And that's going
to make it possible

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,080
for us to do the optimal
thing at each stage.

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,400
So when I build it from the
top down, the best I can do

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,520
is well, it'll fall off.

77
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,040
I need to have it you
know, halfway across.

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,470
That's the best I can do.

79
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,000
So the top one I'm going
to build like that.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,730
I'm going to take it as
far to the left as I can.

81
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,910
And then I'm going to
put the next one down

82
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,160
as far to the left as I can.

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,450
And then the next one as
far to the left as I can.

84
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,740
That was a little too far.

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,350
And then I'm going to do the
next one as far to the left

86
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,382
as I can.

87
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,250
And then I'm going
to do the next one --

88
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,450
well let's line it up first --
as far to the left as I can.

89
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,150
OK?

90
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,036
And then the next one as
far to the left as I can.

91
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:09,920
All right.

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,700
Now those of you who are in
this line can see, all right,

93
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,650
I succeeded.

94
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,740
All right, that's over the edge.

95
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,050
All right?

96
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,604
So it can be done.

97
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:22,390
All right.

98
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,590
All right.

99
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,750
So now we know that we can
get farther than you know,

100
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,500
we can make it overflow.

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,390
So the question now
is, how far can I get?

102
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,240
OK.

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,630
Do you think I can get to here?

104
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,260
Can I get to the end over here?

105
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,022
So how many people think I
can get this far over to here?

106
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:51,730
How many people think
I can get this far?

107
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,525
Well you know,
remember, I'm going

108
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,519
to have to use more
than just this one

109
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,560
more block that I've got.

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
I don't, right?

111
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,900
Obviously I'm
thinking, actually I do

112
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,330
have some more blocks at home.

113
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,294
But, OK.

114
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:04,085
We're not going to.

115
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,510
But anyway, do you think
I can get over to here?

116
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,710
How many people say yes?

117
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,060
And how many people say no?

118
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,180
More people said no then yes.

119
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,680
All right.

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,480
So maybe the stopping place
is some mysterious number

121
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,995
in between here.

122
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:20,690
All right?

123
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,720
Well OK.

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,840
So now we're going
to do the arithmetic.

125
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,870
And we're going to figure out
what happens with this problem.

126
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,500
OK?

127
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,175
So let's do it.

128
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:35,760
All right, so now
again the idea is,

129
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:46,710
the idea is we're going to start
with the top, the top block.

130
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,450
We'll call that
block number one.

131
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,295
And then the farthest,
if you like, to the right

132
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:57,920
that you can put a
block underneath it,

133
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,070
is exactly halfway.

134
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,610
All right, well, that's
the best job I can do.

135
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,270
Now in order to make my
units work out easily,

136
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm going to decide to call
the length of the block 2.

137
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,090
All right?

138
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,000
And that means if I
start at location 0,

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,550
then the first place where I
am is supposed to be halfway.

140
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,070
And that will be 1.

141
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,660
OK so the first step in the
process is 1 more to the right.

142
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,610
Or if you like, if I
were building up --

143
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,068
which is what you would actually
have to do in real life --

144
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:39,280
it would be 1 to the left.

145
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,610
OK now the next one.

146
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,294
Now here is the
way that you start

147
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,460
figuring out the arithmetic.

148
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,190
The next one is based
on a physical principle.

149
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,350
Which is that the farthest
I can stick this next block

150
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,950
underneath is what's called the
center of mass of these two,

151
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,136
which is exactly halfway here.

152
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,760
That is, there's a
quarter of this guy,

153
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,400
and a quarter of that
guy balancing each other.

154
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Right?

155
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,160
So that's as far as I can go.

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,625
If I go farther than
that, it'll fall over.

157
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,600
So that's the absolute
farthest I can do.

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,630
So the next block is
going to be over here.

159
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,210
And a quarter of 2 is 1/2.

160
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,552
So this is 3/2 here.

161
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:24,430
All right so we went to 1.

162
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,960
We went to 3/2 here.

163
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,300
And then I'm going to keep on
going with this eventually.

164
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,140
All right so we're
going to figure out

165
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,770
what happens with this stack.

166
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,774
Question?

167
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:40,065
AUDIENCE: How do
you know that this

168
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,670
is the best way to optimize?

169
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,515
PROFESSOR: The
question is how do I

170
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,870
know that this is the
best way to optimize?

171
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,099
I can't answer that question.

172
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,640
But I can tell you
that it's the best

173
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,735
way if I start with
a top like this,

174
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:53,860
and the next one like this.

175
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,100
Right, because I'm
doing the farthest

176
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,470
possible at each stage.

177
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,840
That actually has a name
in computer science, that's

178
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,610
called the greedy algorithm.

179
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm trying to do the best
possible at each stage.

180
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,040
The greedy algorithm
starting from the bottom

181
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,420
is an extremely bad strategy.

182
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,790
Because when you do that,
you stack it this way,

183
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,120
and it almost falls over.

184
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,050
And then the next time
you can't do anything.

185
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,030
So the greedy algorithm is
terrible from the bottom.

186
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,225
This is the greedy algorithm
starting from the top,

187
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,455
and it turns out
to do much better

188
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:25,580
then the greedy algorithm
starting from the bottom.

189
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,913
But of course I'm not addressing
whether there might not

190
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:31,500
be some other incredibly clever
strategy where I wiggle around

191
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,260
and make it go up.

192
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,676
I'm not addressing
that question.

193
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:36,130
All right?

194
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,838
It turns out this is
the best you can do.

195
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:40,790
But that's not clear.

196
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,650
All right so now, here
we have this thing.

197
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,600
And now I have to figure out
what the arithmetic pattern is,

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,340
so that I can figure out what
I was doing with those shapes.

199
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,132
So let's figure out a
thought experiment here.

200
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,526
All right?

201
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:00,900
Now the thought
experiment I want

202
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,450
to imagine for
you is, you've got

203
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:10,070
a stack of a bunch of blocks,
and this is the first N blocks.

204
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,310
All right?

205
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,010
And now we're going to
put one underneath it.

206
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,650
And what we're
going to figure out

207
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,340
is the center of mass
of those N blocks,

208
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,960
which I'm going to
call C sub N. OK.

209
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,615
And that's the place
where I'm going

210
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,320
to put this very next block.

211
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
I'll put it in a
different color here.

212
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Here's the new--
the next block over.

213
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,360
And the next block over
is the (N+1)st block.

214
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,380
And now I want you to think
about what's going on here.

215
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,880
If the center of mass
of the first N blocks

216
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,700
is this number, this new
one, it's of length 2.

217
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,470
And its center of
mass is 1 further

218
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,850
to the right than the center
of mass that we had before.

219
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,930
So in other words, I've added to
this configuration of N blocks

220
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,220
one more block,
which is shifted.

221
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,650
Whose center mass
is not lined up

222
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,630
with the center of mass
of this, but actually

223
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,200
over farther to the right.

224
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,170
All right so the
new center of mass

225
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,060
of this new block-- And this is
the extra piece of information

226
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,670
that I want to observe,
is that this thing has

227
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,740
a center of mass at C_N + 1.

228
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,870
It's 1 unit over because
this total length is 2.

229
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,561
So right in the middle there is
1 over, according to my units.

230
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,240
All right now this is
going to make it possible

231
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,970
for me to figure out what
the new center of mass is.

232
00:10:51,970 --> 00:11:04,860
So C_(N+1) is the center
of mass of N+1 blocks.

233
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,910
Now this is really only in the
horizontal variable, right?

234
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm not keeping track of the
center of mass-- Actually

235
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,510
this thing is hard to build
because the center of mass

236
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,240
is also rising.

237
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,830
It's getting higher and higher.

238
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,510
But I'm only keeping track of
its left-right characteristic.

239
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,590
So this is the
x-coordinate of it.

240
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,590
All right so now
here's the idea.

241
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm combining the white
ones, the N blocks,

242
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,630
with the pink one, which
is the one on the bottom.

243
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,020
And there are N
of the white ones.

244
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,520
And there's 1 of the pink one.

245
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,811
And so in order to get the
center of mass of the whole,

246
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:47,700
I have to take the weighted
average of the two.

247
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:56,090
That's N*C_N plus 1 times the
center of mass of the pink one,

248
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,665
which is C_N + 1.

249
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,040
And then I have to divide --
if it's the weighted average

250
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,560
of the total of N +
1 blocks -- by N + 1.

251
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,090
This is going to give me
the new center of mass

252
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,855
of my configuration
at the (N+1)st stage.

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,330
And now I can just
do the arithmetic

254
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,340
and figure out what this is.

255
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,810
And the two C_Ns combine.

256
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:27,560
I get (N+1)C_N +
1, divided by N+1.

257
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,680
And if I combine these two
things and do the cancellation,

258
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,140
that gives me this
recurrence formula,

259
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,040
C_(N+1) is equal to C_N
plus-- There's a little extra.

260
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,010
These two cancel.

261
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,380
That gives me the C_N.

262
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,740
But then I also have 1/(N+1).

263
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,270
Well that's how much gain I
can get in the center of mass

264
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,620
by adding one more block.

265
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,520
That's how much I can
shift things over,

266
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,550
depending on how we're
thinking of things,

267
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,700
to the left or the
right, depending on which

268
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,137
direction we're building them.

269
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,840
All right, so now I'm going
to work out the formulas.

270
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,680
First of all C_1, that was
the center of the first block.

271
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,490
I put its left end at 0; the
center of the first block

272
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,250
is at 1.

273
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,910
That means that C_1 is 1.

274
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,310
OK?

275
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,090
C_2 according to this
formula-- And actually I've

276
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,530
worked it out, we'll check
it in a-- C_2 is C_1 + 1/2.

277
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,380
All right, so that's
the case N = 1.

278
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,130
So this is 1 + 1/2.

279
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,420
That's what we already did.

280
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,790
That's the 3/2 number.

281
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,320
Now the next one is C_2 + 1/3.

282
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,530
That's the formula again.

283
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:59,590
And so that comes out
to be 1 + 1/2 + 1/3.

284
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,100
And now you can see
what the pattern is.

285
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,810
C_N-- If you just
keep on going here,

286
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:14,130
C_N is going to be 1
+ 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4...

287
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:21,410
plus 1/N.

288
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,600
So now I would like
you to vote again.

289
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,790
Do you think I can-- Now
that we have the formula,

290
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,830
do you think I can
get over to here?

291
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,180
How many people think
I can get over to here?

292
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,410
How many people think I
can't get over to here?

293
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,700
There's still a lot
of people who do.

294
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,420
So it's still almost 50/50.

295
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,470
That's amazing.

296
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,800
Well so we'll address
that in a few minutes.

297
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,690
So now let me tell
you what's going on.

298
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,050
This C_N of course, is the same
as what we called last time

299
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,530
S_N.

300
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,230
And remember that we actually
estimated the size of this guy.

301
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,620
This is related to what's
called the harmonic series.

302
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,120
And what we showed
was that log N

303
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,690
is less than S_N, which
is less than S_N + 1.

304
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,335
All right?

305
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,360
Now I'm going to
call your attention

306
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,260
to the red part, which
is the divergence

307
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,500
part of this estimate, which
is this one for the time being,

308
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,290
all right.

309
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,780
Just saying that this
thing is growing.

310
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:41,270
And what this is saying is
that as N goes to infinity,

311
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:48,810
log N goes to
infinity, So that means

312
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:57,220
that S_N goes to infinity,
because of this inequality

313
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,980
here.

314
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,780
It's bigger than log N.
And so if N is big enough,

315
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,002
we can get as far as we like.

316
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:06,030
All right?

317
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,312
So I can get to here.

318
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:10,270
And at least half of you,
at least the ones who

319
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,224
voted, that was-- I don't know.

320
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:13,890
We have a quorum here,
but I'm not sure.

321
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,470
We certainly didn't have
a majority on either side.

322
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,420
Anyway this thing
does go to infinity.

323
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,330
So in principle, if
I had enough blocks,

324
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,216
I could get it over to here.

325
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,590
All right, and
that's the meaning

326
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,300
of divergence in this case.

327
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,670
On the other hand, I want
to discuss with you--

328
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,600
And the reason why
I use this example,

329
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,390
is I want to discuss
with you also what's

330
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,460
going on with this
other inequality here,

331
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,360
and what its significance is.

332
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,970
Which is that it's going to
take us a lot of numbers N,

333
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,050
a lot of blocks, to get
up to a certain level.

334
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,180
In other words, I can't do it
with just eight blocks or nine

335
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,800
blocks.

336
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,258
In order to get
over here, I'd have

337
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:06,000
to use quite a few of them.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,120
So let's just see
how many it is.

339
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,230
So I worked this out carefully.

340
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,645
And let's see what I got.

341
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:31,760
So to get across the
lab tables, all right.

342
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,780
This distance here, I
already did this secretly.

343
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,985
But I don't actually even have
enough of these to show you.

344
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:43,834
But, well 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, and 1/2.

345
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:44,750
I guess that's enough.

346
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,240
So it's 6 and a half.

347
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,000
So it's two lab tables
is 13 of these blocks.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,190
All right.

349
00:17:51,190 --> 00:18:00,310
So there are 13 blocks,
which is equal to 26 units.

350
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,020
OK, that's how far
to get across I need.

351
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,090
And the first one is already 2.

352
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,470
So it's really 26
minus 2, which is 24.

353
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,450
Which that's what I need.

354
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,110
OK.

355
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:22,910
So I need log N to be equal
to 24, roughly speaking,

356
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,090
in order to get that far.

357
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,195
So let's just see
how big that is.

358
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,300
All right.

359
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,760
I think I worked this out.

360
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,170
So let's see.

361
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,020
That means that N
is equal to e^24--

362
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:57,160
and if you realize that these
blocks are 3 centimeters high--

363
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,450
OK let's see how many
that we would need here.

364
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,210
That's kind of a lot.

365
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:09,440
Let's see, it's 3
centimeters times e^24,

366
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,660
which is about 8*10^8 meters.

367
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,600
OK.

368
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,810
And that is twice the
distance to the moon.

369
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,190
So OK, so I could do it maybe.

370
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,936
But I would need
a lot of blocks.

371
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:38,435
Right?

372
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:42,190
So that's not very
plausible here, all right.

373
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,380
So those of you who
voted against this

374
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,080
were actually sort
of half right.

375
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,630
And in fact, if you
wanted to get it

376
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,300
to the wall over there,
which is over 30 feet,

377
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,330
the height would be
about the diameter

378
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,360
of the observable universe.

379
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,580
That's kind of a long way.

380
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,780
There's one other thing
that I wanted to point out

381
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,340
to you about this shape here.

382
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,516
Which is that if you
lean to the left, right,

383
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:14,890
if you put your
head like this --

384
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,510
of course you have to be on
your side to look at it --

385
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:25,810
this curve is the shape
of a logarithmic curve.

386
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,240
So in other words, if you think
of the vertical as the x-axis,

387
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,010
and the horizontal that
way is the vertical,

388
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,610
is the up direction,
then this thing

389
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,510
is growing very, very,
very, very slowly.

390
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,030
If you send the x-axis all
the way up to the moon,

391
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,540
the graph still hasn't gotten
across the lab tables here.

392
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,905
It's only partway there.

393
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:52,110
If you go twice the distance
to the moon up that way,

394
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,340
it's gotten finally to that end.

395
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,990
All right so that's how
slowly the logarithm grows.

396
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,189
It grows very, very slowly.

397
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:00,730
And if you look at it another
way, if you stand on your head,

398
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,420
you can see an
exponential curve.

399
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,470
So you get some sense as
to the growth properties

400
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,420
of these functions.

401
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,620
And fortunately these
are protecting us

402
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,550
from all kinds of
stuff that would

403
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,200
happen if there
weren't exponentially

404
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,750
small tails in the world.

405
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,670
Like you know, I could
walk through this wall

406
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,000
which I wouldn't like doing.

407
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,410
OK, now so this is
our last example.

408
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,000
And the important
number, unfortunately we

409
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,790
didn't discover another
important number.

410
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,250
There wasn't an amazing number
place where this stopped.

411
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,160
All we discovered again is
some property of infinity.

412
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,150
So infinity is
still a nice number.

413
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,940
And the theme here is just that
infinity isn't just one thing,

414
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,009
it has a character which
is a rate of growth.

415
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,550
And you shouldn't
just think of there

416
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,072
being one order of infinity.

417
00:21:57,072 --> 00:21:58,530
There are lots of
different orders.

418
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,280
And some of them have
different meaning from others.

419
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,880
All right so that's
the theme I wanted

420
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,900
to do, and just have a
visceral example of infinity.

421
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,570
Now, we're going to move
on now to some other kinds

422
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,210
of techniques.

423
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,790
And this is going to
be our last subject.

424
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,820
What we're going
to talk about is

425
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,320
what are known as power series.

426
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,920
And we've already seen
our first power series.

427
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,240
And I'm going to
remind you of that.

428
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,490
Here we are with power series.

429
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,980
Our first series was this one.

430
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:05,200
And we mentioned last time
that it was equal to 1/(1-x),

431
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,430
for x less than 1.

432
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,040
Well this one is known
as the geometric series.

433
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,050
You didn't use the letter x
last time, I used the letter a.

434
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,910
But this is known as
the geometric series.

435
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:31,550
Now I'm going to show you
one reason why this is true,

436
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,900
why the formula holds.

437
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,050
And it's just the
kind of manipulation

438
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,270
that was done when these
things were first introduced.

439
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,250
And here's the idea of a proof.

440
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:52,670
So suppose that this sum
is equal to some number

441
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,360
S, which is the sum of
all of these numbers here.

442
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,130
The first thing
that I'm going to do

443
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,500
is I'm going to multiply by x.

444
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,326
OK, so if I multiply by x.

445
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:09,560
Let's think about that.

446
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,810
I multiply by x on both the
left and the right-hand side.

447
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:20,990
Then on the left side, I get x
+ x^2 + x^3 plus, and so forth.

448
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,810
And on the right
side, I get S x.

449
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,990
And now I'm going
to subtract the two

450
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,910
equations, one from the other.

451
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,230
And there's a very, very
substantial cancellation.

452
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,180
This whole tail here
gets canceled off.

453
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,030
And the only thing
that's left is the 1.

454
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,950
So when I subtract, I get
1 on the left-hand side.

455
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:53,000
And on the right-hand
side, I get S - S x.

456
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,500
All right?

457
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,850
And now that can be
rewritten as S(1-x).

458
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,180
And so I've got my formula here.

459
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:13,553
This is 1/(1-x) = S. All right.

460
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:26,340
Now this reasoning has one flaw.

461
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,120
It's not complete.

462
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,080
And this reasoning
is basically correct.

463
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:45,680
But it's incomplete because
it requires that S exists.

464
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,100
For example, it doesn't make
any sense in the case x = 1.

465
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,950
So for example in
the case x = 1,

466
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,710
we have 1 + 1 +
1 plus et cetera,

467
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,830
equals whatever we call S. And
then when we multiply through

468
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,798
by 1, we get 1 + 1 + 1 plus...

469
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,640
equals S*1.

470
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
And now you see that
the subtraction gives us

471
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,330
infinity minus infinity is equal
to infinity minus infinity.

472
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,790
That's what's really going on
in the argument in this context.

473
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,340
So it's just nonsense.

474
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,380
I mean it doesn't give
us anything meaningful.

475
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,090
So this argument, it's great.

476
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,000
And it gives us the right
answer, but not always.

477
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,130
And the times when it gives us
the answer, the correct answer,

478
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,800
is when the series
is convergent.

479
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
And that's why we care
about convergence.

480
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,060
Because we want manipulations
like this to be allowed.

481
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,200
So the good case,
this is the red case

482
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,730
that we were
describing last time.

483
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,790
That's the bad case.

484
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,820
But what we want is the good
case, the convergent case.

485
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,770
And that is the case
when x is less than 1.

486
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,182
So this is the convergent case.

487
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:11,960
Yep.

488
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,140
OK, so they're much
more detailed things

489
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,710
to check exactly
what's going on.

490
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,090
But I'm going to just say
general words about how

491
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,099
you recognize convergence.

492
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,140
And then we're not going
to worry about-- so much

493
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,740
about convergence, because
it works very, very well.

494
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,480
And it's always easy
to diagnose when

495
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,590
there's convergence
with a power series.

496
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,450
All right so here's
the general setup.

497
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,510
The general setup
is that we have

498
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:55,600
not just the coefficients 1 all
the time, but any numbers here,

499
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,660
dot, dot, dot.

500
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,310
And we abbreviate that with
the summation notation.

501
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:05,360
This is the sum a_n x^n,
n equals 0 to infinity.

502
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,260
And that's what's known
as a power series.

503
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,370
Fortunately there is
a very simple rule

504
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,260
about how power series converge.

505
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,200
And it's the following.

506
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,480
There's a magic number R which
depends on these numbers here

507
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,160
such that-- And
this thing is known

508
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,460
as a radius of convergence.

509
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,090
In the problem that we had,
it's this number 1 here.

510
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,030
This thing works
for x less than 1.

511
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,190
In our case, it's
maybe x less than R. So

512
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,960
that's some symmetric
interval, right?

513
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,630
That's the same as minus
R less than x less than R,

514
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,310
and so where
there's convergence.

515
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,310
OK, where the series converges.

516
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,810
Converges.

517
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,150
And then there's
the region where

518
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,500
every computation that you
give will give you nonsense.

519
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:24,740
So x greater than R is
the sum a_n x^n diverges.

520
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:42,030
And x equals R is very
delicate, borderline,

521
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,990
and will not be used by us.

522
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,750
OK, we're going to stick inside
the radius of convergence.

523
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,620
Now the way you'll be
able to recognize this,

524
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,920
is the following.

525
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,110
What always happens
is that these numbers

526
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:15,370
tend to 0 exponentially
fast, fast for x in R,

527
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:26,600
and doesn't even tend to 0
at all for x greater than R.

528
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,200
All right so it'll
be totally obvious.

529
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,210
When you look at
this series here,

530
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,040
what's happening
when x less than R

531
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,400
is that the numbers are getting
smaller and smaller, less

532
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,990
than 1.

533
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,290
When x is bigger
than 1, the numbers

534
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,539
are getting bigger and bigger.

535
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,850
There's no chance that
the series converges.

536
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,870
So that's going to be the
case with all power series.

537
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,680
There's going to be a cutoff.

538
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,369
And it'll be one
particular number.

539
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,785
And below that it'll be obvious
that you have convergence,

540
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,368
and you'll be able
to do computations.

541
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,690
And above that every
formula will be wrong

542
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,220
and won't make sense.

543
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,370
So it's a very clean thing.

544
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,660
There is this very
subtle borderline,

545
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,350
but we're not going to
discuss that in this class.

546
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,383
And it's actually not used in
direct studies of power series.

547
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:13,820
AUDIENCE: How can you tell
when the numbers are declining

548
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,780
exponentially fast, whereas
just-- In other words

549
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,030
1/x [INAUDIBLE]?

550
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,470
PROFESSOR: OK so,
the question is

551
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,070
why was I able to tell
you this word here?

552
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,510
Why was I able to tell you
not only is it going to 0,

553
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,550
but it's going
exponentially fast?

554
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm telling you
extra information.

555
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,380
I'm telling you it always
goes exponentially fast.

556
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,556
You can identify it.

557
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,620
In other words, you'll see it.

558
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,490
And it will happen
every single time.

559
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,600
I'm just promising you
that it works that way.

560
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,900
And it's really
for the same reason

561
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,840
that it works that way
here, that these are powers.

562
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,760
And what's going on
over here is there are,

563
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,181
it's close to powers,
with these a_n's.

564
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:54,640
All right?

565
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,960
There's a long discussion
of radius of convergence

566
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,350
in many textbooks.

567
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:04,670
But really it's not necessary,
all right, for this purpose?

568
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,418
Yeah?

569
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:07,090
AUDIENCE: How do you find R?

570
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,400
PROFESSOR: The question
was how do you find R?

571
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,316
Yes, so I just said,
there's a long discussion

572
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:12,660
for how you find the radius
of convergence in textbooks.

573
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,800
But we will not be
discussing that here.

574
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,680
And it won't be
necessary for you.

575
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,890
Because it will be obvious in
any given series what the R is.

576
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,650
It will always
either 1 or infinity.

577
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,850
It will always work for
all x, or maybe it'll

578
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,820
stop at some point.

579
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,280
But it'll be very
clear where it stops,

580
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,201
as it is for the
geometric series.

581
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,070
All right?

582
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,639
OK, so now I need to
give you the basic facts,

583
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:40,805
and give you a few examples.

584
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,420
So why are we looking
at these series?

585
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,010
Well the answer is we're
looking at these series

586
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,270
because the role that
they play is exactly

587
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,420
the reverse of
this equation here.

588
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,540
That is -- and this is a theme
which I have tried to emphasize

589
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,730
throughout this course -- you
can read equalities in two

590
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,870
directions.

591
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,610
Both are interesting, typically.

592
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,116
You can think, I don't know
what the value of this is.

593
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:19,240
Here's a way of evaluating.

594
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,540
And in other words,
the right side

595
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,090
is a formula for the left side.

596
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,400
Or you can think
of the left side

597
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,140
as being a formula
for the right side.

598
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,230
And the idea of series is
that they're flexible enough

599
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,780
to represent all
of the functions

600
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,300
that we've encountered
in this course.

601
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,069
This is the tool which is very
much like the decimal expansion

602
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:43,610
which allows you to
represent numbers

603
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,130
like the square root of 2.

604
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,520
Now we're going to be
representing all the numbers,

605
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,550
all the functions that we know:
e^x, arctangent, sine, cosine.

606
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,280
All of those functions
become completely flexible,

607
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,970
and completely available to us,
and computationally available

608
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,900
to us directly.

609
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,440
So that's what
this is a tool for.

610
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,580
And it's just like
decimal expansions

611
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,240
giving you handle
on all real numbers.

612
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,110
So here's how it works.

613
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:28,170
The rules for
convergent power series

614
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:33,920
are just like polynomials.

615
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,660
All of the manipulations
that you do for power series

616
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,120
are essentially the
same as for polynomials.

617
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,190
So what kinds of things
do we do with polynomials?

618
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,130
We add them.

619
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,445
We multiply them together.

620
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,790
We do substitutions.

621
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,290
Right?

622
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,970
We take one function
of another function.

623
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,030
We divide them.

624
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,590
OK.

625
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,040
And these are all really not
very surprising operations.

626
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,710
And we will be able to do
them with power series too.

627
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,370
The ones that are interesting,
really interesting

628
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,360
for calculus, are the last two.

629
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,790
We differentiate them,
and we integrate them.

630
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,060
And all of these
operations we'll

631
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,110
be able to do for
power series as well.

632
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:49,120
So now let's explain
the high points of this.

633
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,530
Which is mainly just
the differentiation

634
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,110
and the integration part.

635
00:35:53,110 --> 00:36:03,200
So if I take a series
like this and so forth,

636
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,054
the formula for its derivative
is just like polynomials.

637
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:10,220
That's what I just said,
it's just like polynomials.

638
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,570
So the derivative of
the constant is 0.

639
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,850
The derivative of
this term is a_1.

640
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,340
This one is plus 2 a_2 x 2 x.

641
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,920
This one is 3 a_3
x^2, et cetera.

642
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,070
That's the formula.

643
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:40,672
Similarly if I
integrate, well there's

644
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:42,130
an unknown constant
which I'm going

645
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,930
to put first rather than last.

646
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,927
Which corresponds sort
of to the a_0 term which

647
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:48,010
is going to get wiped out.

648
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,770
That a_0 term suddenly
becomes a_0 x.

649
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,980
And the anti-derivative of
this next term is a_1 x^2 / 2.

650
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,680
And the next term is a_2
x^3 / 3, and so forth.

651
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,456
Yeah, question?

652
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,357
AUDIENCE: Is that a
series or a polynomial?

653
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:10,190
PROFESSOR: Is this a
series or a polynomial?

654
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,180
Good question.

655
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,700
It's a polynomial if it ends.

656
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,490
If it goes on infinitely
far, then it's a series.

657
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,420
They look practically the
same, polynomials and series.

658
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,286
There's this little
dot, dot, dot here.

659
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,660
Is this a series
or a polynomial?

660
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,780
It's the same rule.

661
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,460
If it stops at a
finite stage, this one

662
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,210
stops at a finite stage.

663
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,074
If it goes on forever,
it goes on forever.

664
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,980
AUDIENCE: So I thought that the
series add up finite numbers.

665
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,735
You can add up terms
of x in series?

666
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,380
PROFESSOR: So an
interesting question.

667
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,435
So the question
that was just asked

668
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:53,060
is I thought that a series
added up finite numbers.

669
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,140
You could add up x?

670
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,900
That was what you said, right?

671
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,140
OK now notice that
I pulled that off

672
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,720
on you by changing the
letter a to the letter

673
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,170
x at the very beginning
of this commentary here.

674
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,760
This is a series.

675
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,630
For each individual value
of x, it's a number.

676
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,790
So in other words, if
I plug in here x = 1/2,

677
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,650
I'm going to add 1
+ 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8,

678
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,470
and I'll get a
number which is 2.

679
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,030
And I'll plug in a number over
here, and I'll get a number.

680
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,820
On the other hand, I can do
this for each value of x.

681
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,770
So the interpretation of this
is that it's a function of x.

682
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,380
And similarly this
is a function of x.

683
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,400
It works when you plug
in the possible values

684
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,330
x between -1 and 1.

685
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,760
So there's really no
distinction there, it's

686
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,010
just I slipped it passed you.

687
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,130
These are functions of x.

688
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,090
And the notion of a
power series is this idea

689
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,860
that you put
coefficients on a series,

690
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,040
but then you allow
yourself the flexibility

691
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,990
to stick powers here.

692
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,884
And that's exactly
what we're doing.

693
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,300
OK there are other
kinds of series

694
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,210
where you stick other
interesting functions in here

695
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,168
like sines and cosines.

696
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:08,620
There are lots of other
series that people study.

697
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,465
And these are the simplest ones.

698
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:12,360
And all those
examples are extremely

699
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,515
helpful for
representing functions.

700
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:18,920
But we're only going to
do this example here.

701
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,610
All right, so here
are the two rules.

702
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:29,880
And now there's only one
other complication here

703
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,350
which I have to explain
to you before giving you

704
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:41,270
a bunch of examples to show you
that this works extremely well.

705
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,960
And the last thing
that I have to do

706
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,460
for you is explain
to you something

707
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,580
called Taylor's formula.

708
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,730
Taylor's formula is the way you
get from the representations

709
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,430
that we're used to of functions,
to a representation in the form

710
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,180
of these coefficients.

711
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,240
When I gave you
the function e^x,

712
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,280
it didn't look
like a polynomial.

713
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,010
And we have to figure
out which of these guys

714
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,090
it is, if it's going to
fall into our category here.

715
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,370
And here's the formula.

716
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,430
I'll explain to you how
it works in a second.

717
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,650
So the formula is
f(x) turns out--

718
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,560
There's a formula in terms
of the derivatives of f.

719
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,260
Namely, you
differentiate n times,

720
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,260
and you evaluate it at 0, and
you divide by n factorial,

721
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,640
and multiply by x^n.

722
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,510
So here's Taylor's formula.

723
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,270
This tells you what
the Taylor series is.

724
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,330
Now about half of our job
for the next few minutes

725
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,630
is going to be to
give examples of this.

726
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,810
But let me just explain
to you why this has to be.

727
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,830
If you pick out this number
here, this is the a_n,

728
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,290
the magic number a_n here.

729
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,450
So let's just illustrate it.

730
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:15,090
If f(x) happens to be a_0 + a_1
x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 plus dot,

731
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:15,940
dot, dot.

732
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,810
And now I differentiate
it, right?

733
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,416
I get a 1 + 2 a_2 x + 3 a_3 x.

734
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:33,120
If I differentiate it another
time, I get 2 a_2 plus 3--

735
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,560
sorry, 3*2*a_3 x
plus dot, dot, dot.

736
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:47,360
And now a third time, I
get 3*2 a_3 plus et cetera.

737
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:54,000
So this next term is really in
disguise, 4*3*2 x a-- sorry,

738
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,410
a_4 x.

739
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,410
That's what really comes down if
I kept track of the fourth term

740
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,980
there.

741
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,660
So now here is my function.

742
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,980
But now you see if
I plug in x = 0,

743
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,750
I can pick off the third term.

744
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:21,079
f triple prime of 0
is equal to 3*2 a_3.

745
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,620
Right, because all the rest of
those terms, when I plug in 0,

746
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,080
are just 0.

747
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,730
Here's the formula.

748
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,610
And so the pattern here is this.

749
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,860
And what's really going on here
is this is really 3*2*1 a_3.

750
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:48,480
And in general a_n is
equal to f, nth derivative,

751
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,410
divided by n!.

752
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:56,224
And of course, n!, I remind
you, is n times n-1 times

753
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,570
n-2, all the way down to 1.

754
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,980
Now there's one more
crazy convention

755
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,220
which is always used.

756
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,300
Which is that there's something
very strange here down at 0,

757
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,990
which is that 0 factorial turns
out, has to be set equal to 1.

758
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,270
All right, so that's
what you do in order

759
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,540
to make this formula work out.

760
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,623
And that's one of the
reasons for this convention.

761
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,600
All right.

762
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:36,680
So my next goal is to
give you some examples.

763
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:45,280
And let's do a couple.

764
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,880
So here's, well
you know, I'm going

765
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,120
to have to let you see
a few of them next time.

766
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,960
But let me just tell
you this one, which

767
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,820
is by far the most impressive.

768
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:11,840
So what happens with e^x -- if
the function is f(x) = e^x --

769
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:18,190
is that its derivative
is also e^x.

770
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,390
And its second
derivative is also e^x.

771
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,010
And it just keeps
on going that way.

772
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,180
They're all the same.

773
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:30,010
So that means that these
numbers in Taylor's formula,

774
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,020
in the numerator--
The nth derivative

775
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,090
is very easy to evaluate.

776
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,280
It's just e^x.

777
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,890
And if I evaluate it
at x = 0, I just get 1.

778
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,990
So all of those
numerators are 1.

779
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:54,721
So the formula here, is the sum
n equals 0 to infinity, of 1/n!

780
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:55,220
x^n.

781
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,730
In particular, we now have
an honest formula for e

782
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,800
to the first power.

783
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,330
Which is just e.

784
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:13,790
Which if I plug it in, x = 1, I
get 1, this is the n = 0 term.

785
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,590
Plus 1, This is the n = 1 term.

786
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,870
Plus 1/2!

787
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,550
plus 1/3!

788
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,150
plus 1/4!

789
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,540
Right?

790
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,360
So this is our first
honest formula for e.

791
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,960
And also, this is
how you compute

792
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,340
the exponential function.

793
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:49,490
Finally if you take a
function like sin x,

794
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,130
what you'll discover is that
we can complete the sort

795
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,957
of strange business that we did
at the beginning of the course

796
00:45:55,957 --> 00:46:03,480
-- or cos x -- where we took
the linear and quadratic

797
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,950
approximations.

798
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:10,060
Now we're going to get complete
formulas for these functions.

799
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:16,297
sin x turns out to be
equal to x - x^3 / 3!

800
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:19,233
+ x^5 / 5!

801
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:24,860
- x^7 / 7!, et cetera.

802
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,680
And cos x = 1 - x^2 / 2!

803
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,950
-- that's the same as this
2 here -- plus x^4 / 4!

804
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:42,590
minus x^6 / 6!, plus et cetera.

805
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:48,030
Now these may feel like they're
hard to memorize because I've

806
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,425
just pulled them out of a hat.

807
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,630
I do expect you to know them.

808
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,990
They're actually extremely
similar formulas.

809
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:02,230
The exponential here just has
this collection of factorials.

810
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,860
The sine is all the odd
powers with alternating signs.

811
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,260
And the cosine is all the even
powers with alternating signs.

812
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,130
So all three of them form
part of the same family.

813
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,140
So this will actually
make it easier

814
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,150
for you to remember,
rather than harder.

815
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:24,100
And so with that, I'll
leave the practice

816
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,210
on differentiation
for next time.

817
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,570
And good luck, everybody.

818
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,940
I'll talk to you individually.
