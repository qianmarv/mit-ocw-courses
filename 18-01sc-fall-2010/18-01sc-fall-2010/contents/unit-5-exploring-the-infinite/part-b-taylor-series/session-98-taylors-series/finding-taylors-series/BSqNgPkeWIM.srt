00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:07,390
Hi.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,850
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,450
In class, Professor Jerison
and Professor Miller

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,510
have taught you a little
bit about Taylor series

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,390
and some of the manipulations
you can do with them,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,434
and have computed a bunch
of examples for you.

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,850
So I have three
more examples here

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,150
of functions whose Taylor
series are nice to compute.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,460
So the first one is cosh x.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,050
That's the hyperbolic cosine.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,220
So just to remind
you, this can be

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,345
written in terms of the
exponential function as e

13
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:35,940
to the x plus e to
the minus x over 2.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,600
The second one is
the function 2 times

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,525
sine of x times cosine of
x, just your regular sine

16
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:41,720
and cosine here.

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,240
And the third one is x times
the logarithm of the quantity 1

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,620
minus x cubed.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,070
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,815
to work out the Taylor series
for these three functions,

21
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:54,690
come back, and we can
work them out together.

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,961
So here we have three
functions whose Taylor series

23
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,960
we're trying to compute.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,150
Let's start with the first
one and go from there.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,940
So this first one is
the hyperbolic cosine

26
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,525
that's given by the formula e
to the x plus e to the minus

27
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:14,351
x over 2.

28
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:15,850
So there are a
couple different ways

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,030
you could go about this one.

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,020
This is actually,
the hyperbolic cosine

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,420
is very susceptible to
the method of just using

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,440
the formula that you have.

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,520
So if you remember,
the derivative

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,660
of the hyperbolic cosine
is the hyperbolic sine.

35
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,290
The derivative of
the hyperbolic sine

36
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,720
is the hyperbolic cosine again.

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,750
So this function has very
easy-to-understand derivatives,

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,390
which you can see, you know,
just by looking at its formula.

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,130
It's easy to understand, because
the exponential function has

40
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,390
very simple derivatives,
and e to the the minus

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,440
x also has very
simple derivatives.

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,180
So you could do it like that.

43
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,221
The other thing you could
do, is that you already

44
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,250
know the Taylor
series for e to the x.

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,500
And I believe you've also
seen the Taylor series for e

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,530
to the minus x, and even if you
haven't, you can figure it out

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,800
just by substitution.

48
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,560
So if you remember, so e to the
x is given by the sum from n

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,940
equals 0 to infinity of x
to the n over n factorial.

50
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,410
I'm going to pull
the 1/2 out in front.

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,230
And e to the minus x is
given by the same thing,

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,250
if you put in minus x for x.

53
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,740
So it's n equals 0 to infinity,
so that works out to minus 1

54
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,580
to the n x to the
n or n factorial.

55
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,560
Now, when you add these
two series together,

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,110
what you see is that when
n is even, over here,

57
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,830
you have x to the n over n
factorial, and over here,

58
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,700
you have x to the
n over n factorial.

59
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,690
So what you get is,
well, you get 2 x

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,200
to the n over n factorial, and
then you multiply by a half,

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,900
so you just get x to
the n over n factorial.

62
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,920
When n is odd, here you have
x to the n over n factorial,

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,730
and here you have minus 1 x
to the n over n factorial.

64
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,630
So you add them and you get 0.

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,820
So what happens is that
this series looks just

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,970
like the series for e to the
x, except the odd terms have

67
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,850
died off.

68
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:03,530
So we're left with just 1 plus x
squared over 2 factorial plus x

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,050
to the fourth over 4 factorial
plus x to the sixth over 6

70
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,810
factorial, and so on.

71
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,100
And if you wanted to write
this in summation notation,

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,710
you could write it
as the sum from n

73
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:24,870
equals 0 to infinity of x
to the 2n over 2n factorial.

74
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,880
So this is the Taylor series for
the hyperbolic cosine function.

75
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,891
Also, if you wanted, say,
the hyperbolic sine function,

76
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,390
you could do something
very similar,

77
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,120
or you could remember that
the hyperbolic sine is

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,890
the derivative of the
hyperbolic cosine,

79
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,870
and just take a derivative
right from this expression.

80
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,965
One other thing that
you should notice

81
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,830
is that this looks very similar
to the expression of the Taylor

82
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,010
series for cosine of x.

83
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,730
So more of our sort
of funny coincidences

84
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,220
between regular trig functions
and hyperbolic trig functions.

85
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,720
All right.

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
That's the first one.

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,450
How about the second one?

88
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,620
So here we have just some
regular trig functions.

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,460
We have 2 sine x cosine x.

90
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,660
Let me see where
I've got some space.

91
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,390
I can do it right here.

92
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,820
Let me box off a little
space for myself.

93
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,890
So 2 sine x cosine x-- there
are a couple different ways

94
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,430
you could proceed
with this function.

95
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,080
So one is, you know the Taylor
series for sine x and cosine x

96
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,880
already.

97
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,670
So if all you wanted was a few
terms of this Taylor series,

98
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,800
one natural thing to do would be
to take the series for sine x,

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,970
take the series for cosine
x, multiply them together

100
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,470
like you would
multiply polynomials,

101
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,300
and what you would get
is the Taylor series

102
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,467
for this expression,
for this function.

103
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,550
That's one way to proceed.

104
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,740
That works perfectly well.

105
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,790
Another thing you
could do, is you

106
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,080
could try taking derivatives.

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,040
You could have a situation
where every time you

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,980
take a derivative, you
apply product rule.

109
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,813
It's going to get more
and more complicated.

110
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:48,780
It still works.

111
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,950
It's a little complicated
to do it that way,

112
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,719
if you wanted more
than just a few terms.

113
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:56,260
The other thing you could do,
is you could remember your trig

114
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,400
identities.

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
So if you look at
this expression,

116
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,210
this should be familiar to you,
because it's just sine of 2x.

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,740
So once you realize
that this is sine of 2x,

118
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,152
there's a much,
much shorter path

119
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:12,610
available to you, which is that
you already know the Taylor

120
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,710
series for sine of x,
so what you can do,

121
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,290
is you can just plug in 2x
into that Taylor series.

122
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,550
So sine of x is-- well, so OK.

123
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,560
So sine of x is x--
so in this case,

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,850
that's going to be 2x--
then minus, so in sine of x,

125
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,050
we have x cubed
over 3 factorial.

126
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:37,350
So here we're going to have 2x
cubed over 3 factorial plus--

127
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,850
OK.

128
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,730
So then, you know, and so on.

129
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:45,560
So here we'll have 2x to
the fifth over 5 factorial

130
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,527
minus-- so on.

131
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,610
If you wanted to write
this in summation notation,

132
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:56,570
you could write it as the sum
from n equals 0 to infinity.

133
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,500
Well, the denominator has got
to be 2n plus 1 factorial,

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,310
because we want it to
go through the odds.

135
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:10,140
And then we've got minus 1 to
the n times 2 to the 2n plus 1

136
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,360
times x to the 2n plus 1.

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,625
So this is 2x.

138
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,340
What we've got here, if you
didn't have the 2's there,

139
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,371
that would just be the
series for the regular sine.

140
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:20,870
OK.

141
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,570
So this is the series for this
function, 2 sine x cosine x.

142
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,039
And I'll go over here
to do the third one.

143
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,080
So what is the third one?

144
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,880
It's x ln 1 minus x cubed.

145
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,400
Well, what can we
do with this series?

146
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,780
The x out front is just
multiplying this logarithm

147
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,290
part.

148
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,190
That's something we
can save until the end.

149
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,820
If we can figure out what the
Taylor series for the ln of 1

150
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,382
minus x cubed part is, then
we just multiply x into it,

151
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:54,840
and that'll give us the Taylor
series for this whole thing.

152
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,010
So the x out front
is pretty simple.

153
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,460
So now what about this ln
of 1 minus x cubed stuff?

154
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,251
Well, a thing to remember
is, does it remind you

155
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,500
of anything we've done before?

156
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,821
Well, we have a Taylor series
for a logarithm function,

157
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,320
right?

158
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,820
We've already seen in
lecture, I believe,

159
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,240
we've seen that
ln of 1 plus x is

160
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:26,610
equal to x minus x squared
over 2 plus x cubed over 3,

161
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:32,810
minus x to the fourth over four,
and so on, alternating signs.

162
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,070
Notice that the denominators,
when you have a logarithm,

163
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,330
these are not factorials.

164
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,240
These are just the integer 2,
the integer 3, the integer 4,

165
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,100
unlike for exponentials
and trig functions.

166
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,990
So this is what
log of 1 plus x--

167
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,454
this is the Taylor series
for log of 1 plus x.

168
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:50,620
Well, how does that help us?

169
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,100
Well, log of 1 minus x cubed we
can get from log of 1 plus x,

170
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,780
with the appropriate
substitution.

171
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,550
So in particular,
we just have to put

172
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,430
minus x cubed in for x here.

173
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,130
So what does that give us?

174
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:12,090
It gives us the ln of 1 minus
x cubed is equal to-- well,

175
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:20,510
minus x cubed minus, so we
put minus x cubed in here,

176
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,870
we square it, and we
just get x to the sixth.

177
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,214
x to the sixth over 2.

178
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:25,880
Then, all right.

179
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,660
So minus x cubed quantity
cubed is minus x to the ninth.

180
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,690
So minus x to the ninth over 3,
minus x to the twelfth over 4,

181
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,710
and so on.

182
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:48,840
And so finally, x ln
of 1 minus x cubed,

183
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,660
we just get by multiplying this
whole expression through by x.

184
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,592
So this is equal to minus
x to the fourth minus x

185
00:08:56,592 --> 00:09:02,203
to the seventh over 2 minus
x-- whoops, not ten-- minus

186
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:09,504
x to the tenth over 3, minus
x to the 13 over 4, and so on.

187
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:11,170
And I'll leave it as
an exercise for you

188
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,850
to figure out how to write
this in summation notation,

189
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,497
if you wanted.

190
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:17,080
So just quickly to summarize,
we had these three power series,

191
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,029
these three functions
that we started out with,

192
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,820
and we used a bunch of
different techniques

193
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,236
that we've learned in order
to compute their power series.

194
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:29,520
So over here, we took the
function that we'd seen,

195
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,010
and we knew a formula for it
in terms of other functions

196
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,760
that we already knew, and so we
plugged in those power series,

197
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,447
and used our addition
rule for power series.

198
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,030
We could have also done this one
directly from the definition,

199
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,130
if we had wanted to.

200
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,670
For the second one, for
the 2 sine x cosine x,

201
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,965
we recognized that
as something that

202
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,750
is susceptible to a
substitution, although also,

203
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,290
with a little more,
work, we could

204
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,220
have done it by a couple
of different methods.

205
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,810
For example, by multiplying
two power series together.

206
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,420
And finally, for this
third one, for the x ln

207
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,586
of 1 minus x cubed, we first
saw the substitution here

208
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,960
that we could make, and then
we just did a multiplication

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,050
by a polynomial, which is
a relatively easy thing

210
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,970
to do for power series.

211
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,980
So that's what we did
in this recitation,

212
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,114
and I'll leave it at that.
