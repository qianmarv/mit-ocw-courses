00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,620
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,190
In this video what
I'd like us to do

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,350
is practice Taylor series.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,360
So I want us to write
the Taylor series

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,960
for the following
function, f of x

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,126
equals 3 x cubed plus 4 x
squared minus 2x plus 1.

7
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:23,500
So why don't you
pause the video,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,680
take some time to work on
that, and then I'll come back

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
and show you what I get.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,400
All right, welcome back.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,590
Well, we want to find the Taylor
series for this polynomial

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,860
f of x equals 3 x cubed plus
4 x squared minus 2x plus 1.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,120
So what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to write down

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Taylor's-- or the expression
we have for the sum,

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,820
for the Taylor series in general
and then I'm going to start

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,220
computing what I need and
I'm going to see what I get.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,650
So what do I need to remember?

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,270
Well let's remind ourselves
what the formula is.

19
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,780
We should get f of x is
equal to the sum from n

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,770
equals 0 to infinity of the
nth derivative of f at 0 over n

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,550
factorial times x to the n.

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,770
So that's what we want.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,840
So what I obviously
need to start doing

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,156
is figuring out
derivatives of f at 0.

25
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,030
And so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,230
to make myself a little table.

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:40,150
So let's see, we're going
to say f 0 at 0, f 1 at 0,

28
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,516
f 2 at 0, f 3 at 0, f 4 at 0.

29
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:47,890
And I'm getting
tired of writing,

30
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,750
so I'm going to stop there.

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,060
OK, so let's take the function--
the zeroth derivative of f

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,770
is just the function itself,
so let's come back here.

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,280
What is the function if I
evaluate it at x equals 0?

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,250
0, 0, 0, 1.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,750
I get 1.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,460
All right.

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,120
What is the first derivative?

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,280
So I'm going to write
out the first derivative

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,220
and then I'm going to say I'm
evaluating it at x equals 0.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,750
So the first derivative looks
like it's 9 x squared plus 8

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,020
x minus 2.

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,610
So I'm gonna write this down.

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,340
9 x squared plus 8 x minus 2.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,760
Evaluate it at x equals 0.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,800
0, 0.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I get negative 2.

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,080
All right, well, let me
take the second derivative.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,020
OK let's see what I get here.

49
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,790
I get 18x plus 8.

50
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,180
And I'm going to evaluate
that at x equals 0.

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,950
This is just a way
to write, I'm going

52
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,760
to evaluate what's here
at x equal this number,

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,810
so if you haven't
seen that before.

54
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,040
So I get 8.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,500
OK and then the third
derivative is 18, oh just 18.

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,710
Evaluate it at x equals 0.

57
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,180
I get 18.

58
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,640
And then the fourth derivative.

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,514
What's the derivative
of a constant function?

60
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:18,710
It's 0.

61
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,460
What do you think the fifth
derivative is evaluated at 0?

62
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,580
Looks like it'll be 0.

63
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,190
You take the sixth derivative.

64
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,940
Looks like everything
bigger than 3--

65
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:37,770
so the nth derivative at 0 is
equal to 0 for n bigger than 3.

66
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,270
So it looks like we should
only have 4 terms in this.

67
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,875
So that maybe seems a little
weird, but let's keep going

68
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,750
and see what happens.

69
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,041
Let's start plugging things in.

70
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,944
So again, let's
remember the formula.

71
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,610
I'm going to walk
over here to the right

72
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,318
and I'm going to start
using that formula

73
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,300
and using these numbers that
I have and writing it out.

74
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,080
So the first term is going to
be the function evaluated at 0

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,930
divided by 0 factorial times 1.

76
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,150
0 factorial is 1,
so it's just going

77
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,170
to be the function
evaluated at 0 times 1.

78
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,150
The function evaluated
at 0, we said was 1,

79
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,850
so that's the first term
in the Taylor series.

80
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,881
OK what's the next term?

81
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,880
The next term, remember,
is the first derivative

82
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,685
evaluated at 0 divided
by 1 factorial, which

83
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,995
is still 1, times x.

84
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,620
So the first derivative,
if I come back

85
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,750
over here, evaluated
at 0, I get negative 2.

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,390
So I'm going to get minus 2x.

87
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,370
The next term, so I had zeroth
derivative, first derivative,

88
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,900
now I'm at the
second derivative.

89
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,840
Now it's getting confusing.

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,673
I'm going to start
writing the things above.

91
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,630
The second derivative
evaluated at 0

92
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,280
divided by 2 factorial
times x squared.

93
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,725
That's what I should have here.

94
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:50,820
Let's come over here.

95
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,180
Second derivative
evaluated at 0 was 8.

96
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,460
So it's going to be 8 over
2, 'cause 2 factorial is 2,

97
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,330
x squared.

98
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,050
So it's going to be
plus 4 x squared.

99
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,130
And then I have to have the
third derivative evaluated

100
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,339
at 0 divided by 3
factorial times x cubed.

101
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,130
What's 3 factorial?

102
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,700
3 factorial is 6.

103
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,760
What was the third
derivative evaluated at 0?

104
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,180
It was 18.

105
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,680
18 divided by 6 is 3.

106
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,940
So I get plus 3 x cubed.

107
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,830
And all the other terms were 0,
so I'll just stop writing them.

108
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,890
OK now if you watched the
video all the way through here,

109
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,160
at some point maybe you said
"Christine, this is madness."

110
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
Well why is it madness?

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,690
Because what is this?

112
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,434
Well this is the
function again, right?

113
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,850
It's exactly what
we started with.

114
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,770
The order is opposite of
what it was before 'cause now

115
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,910
the powers go up
instead of down,

116
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,500
but it's the same polynomial.

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,710
OK we talked about
this briefly, I think,

118
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,370
when we were doing some
quadratic approximations.

119
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,970
And I mentioned way back
that quadratic approximations

120
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,620
of polynomials at x equals 0
are just the polynomials again.

121
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,270
This is the exact same
kind of thing happening.

122
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,090
Because what is
the Taylor series?

123
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,450
It's just better and
better approximations

124
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,300
as n gets larger and larger.

125
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,740
So if I wanted to
have a fourth order

126
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,390
approximation of this
function f of x at x equals 0,

127
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,660
I would get the
same function back.

128
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,050
That's really the idea
of what's happening here.

129
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,280
So maybe you saw the sort
of trick in this question,

130
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,500
and when you saw this
problem you laughed at me

131
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,125
and you said, "Well
I'm just going

132
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,499
to write down the function
again and I'll be done."

133
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,040
Maybe you didn't
see that right away,

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,690
and if you didn't see
that right away that's OK.

135
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,150
I bet you're in good company.

136
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,720
And it's totally fine
because now you've seen this.

137
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,050
You've seen how it works out.

138
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,590
And you know, hey, now any
time I see a polynomial

139
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,550
and I want to do the Taylor
series for this polynomial,

140
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,130
I just have to write down
the polynomial again.

141
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,800
So that was the main
goal of this video.

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,760
It took us a long time to get
there, but I think we got it.

143
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,620
So the answer to the ultimate
answer to the question of

144
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,340
write the Taylor series
of this function,

145
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,950
it's just this function again.

146
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,661
All right, that's
where I'll stop.
