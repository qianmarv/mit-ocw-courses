00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,410
Hi.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,140
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,820
You've been learning about
infinite series of constants.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,050
Adding up, you know,
series of numbers.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,470
And one thing that we've talked
about are divergent

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,410
series and convergent series,
and rates of divergence a

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,470
little bit.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,785
So suppose you wanted to
run an experiment.

10
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,960
So suppose you started with the
series, log n over n, and

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,770
you started summing--

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,250
I picked n equals 3.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,480
It doesn't actually
matter that much--

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,280
started summing at n equals
3, and going to infinity.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,690
And you set your computer to
sort of keep track of what the

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,790
partial sums are as
it does this.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,170
So you wanted to produce a list
of partial sums. And you

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,270
know, maybe to get a good feel
for this rate of divergence,

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,860
what you want to do is let it
run for a long time, collect a

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,970
whole bunch of values.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,700
Say, you know, stop when
it gets to some

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,150
fairly large number.

23
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,920
So suppose we run this, and we
ask it to stop when it gets to

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,750
a partial sum that's greater
than or equal to 5,000.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,740
You know, whatever.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,780
A moderately large integer
or number.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,020
Doesn't have to be an integer.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,500
So it's going to stop as soon
as it reaches a partial sum

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
that's bigger than 5,000.

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,975
So what I want to know, is how
long is that going to take?

31
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:24,970
Now of course, that depends
on your computer.

32
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,740
So let's just say, you know,
for sake of argument, that

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,880
your computer--

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,460
this is generous to
your computer.

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,990
At least my computer doesn't go
this fast-- that it takes

36
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,150
10 to the minus 20 seconds to
add an additional term to the

37
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,670
partial sums.

38
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,040
So suppose that your computer
takes 10 to the minus 20

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,960
seconds for each additional
summand.

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,390
How long, how many terms of the
series, how long are you

41
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,390
going to wait around, waiting
for this sum to get to 5,000?

42
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,770
So that's the question.

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,145
Why don't you pause the video,
take some time, try

44
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,130
and work this out.

45
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,750
This is probably not a quite
good question for

46
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,750
experimentation.

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,800
I would advise against actually
running it while you

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,750
wait to continue
with the video.

49
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,520
But of course, you're
welcome to try.

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,700
But you can, you know, work this
out, come back, and we'll

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,950
talk about it together.

52
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:25,500

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,200
Welcome back.

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,990
Hopefully you had some fun
with this problem.

55
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,320
Let's let's talk about it.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,530
So what we want to do, is we
want to look at this series

57
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,670
and say, you know, about
how long it's going to

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,160
take to get to 5,000.

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,240
What we want-- which partial
sum of this series is about

60
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
equal to 5,000 for
the first time?

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,540
So let's give a notation
there.

62
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,580
So let's call sN, big N now, s
big N is equal to nth partial

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,290
sum-- well, OK.

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,740
Let me not make it the
nth partial sum.

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,200
Let me just make it the sum
when the top is big N. So

66
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,470
going from 3 to big N of log
little n divided by n.

67
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,730
So first of all, the answer
could be a priori.

68
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,550
The answer could be forever.

69
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,830
It might be that series
converges to some number less

70
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,170
than 5,000.

71
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,090
So if that were to happen, then,
you know, no matter how

72
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,460
long you waited around, you
wouldn't get there.

73
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,630
But we can check that
that's not the case.

74
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,910
So we can check that this
series diverges.

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,790
So how can we check that?

76
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:44,390
So the series diverges by the
integral test, because the

77
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:53,650
integral of log x over x dx
from, say, 3 to infinity,

78
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,190
though of course the bounds,
the lower bound, 3, is not

79
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,130
crucially important.

80
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,850
This is something we know
how to integrate.

81
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,690
This is equal to 1/2 log of
x quantity squared, taken

82
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,440
between, well, 3 and infinity.

83
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,260
And anyway, you see that as x
goes to infinity, log of x

84
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,280
goes to infinity, and so log of
x squared goes to infinity.

85
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,530
So this diverges.

86
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,850

87
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,440
So the series does diverge
to positive infinity.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
And as a result of its
divergence to positive

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,240
infinity, we know
that eventually,

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,380
we do get to 5,000.

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,150
OK, so this is, the
answer is not, an

92
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,300
infinite amount of time.

93
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,410
The answer is some finite
amount of time.

94
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,730
So now the question
is, how much.

95
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,330
Now, the thing to remember about
the integral test is not

96
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,470
only can it tell you whether
something converges or

97
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,240
diverges, but it gives you a
really good estimate of how

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,980
quickly it converges
or diverges.

99
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,200
So I have over here
a little picture.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,650
This is the function y equals
log of x over x.

101
00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:00,010
So at x equals 1, this function
is 0, and then it

102
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,940
reaches a maximum, and
then tapers down.

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,140
And as x gets larger--

104
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,950
so it's a little hard to
tell in this picture--

105
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,310
at x equals 6, this is still--

106
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,890
well, so the peak here is a
little bit less than 0.4.

107
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,590
At x equals 6, this, the
function value is still bigger

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,860
than a quarter.

109
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,510
But it does eventually go down
to 0, because x grows faster

110
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,250
than log x.

111
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,410
And of course if you were
interested, an interesting

112
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,220
exercise might be really
precise, you know, where, to

113
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,920
figure out precisely, what is
this peak, and what's the

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,780
x-value, and what's the y-value
of that peak point

115
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,160
before it starts turning down.

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,340
If you wanted something
fun to work out.

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,630
And OK.

118
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,940
But that doesn't actually have
anything to do with our

119
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,610
problem, which has to do with
this integral test. So

120
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,570
remember that the integral in
question is the area under

121
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,840
this curve from 3 onwards, and
a partial sum is what you get

122
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,790
when you take a bunch of these
left endpoint rectangles.

123
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,290
And because this function is
decreasing, the rectangles

124
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,200
completely cover the region.

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:09,780
And so the integral test tells
us that the integral from 3 to

126
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:17,760
big N of our function, log x
over x dx, is strictly less

127
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,600
than, well, we want the partial
sum that goes up to,

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,160
so whose right interval here
ends at big N. So that's

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,830
actually the n minus
first partial sum.

130
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,470
So maybe what I'll do, is I'll
add a plus 1 here, and I'll

131
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,120
make this the big Nth partial
sum is bigger than the sum

132
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,630
from 3 to n plus 1
of the function.

133
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,890
And also, if you turn this
around, and you took right

134
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,550
endpoint rectangles instead, you
see that if you chop off

135
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,580
the first rectangle, then what
you get is the, you get an

136
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,350
area less than the integral.

137
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,080
So we also have an
upper bound here.

138
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,250
This is less than or equal to
the very first term, which in

139
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:14,830
our case is ln 3 over 3 plus
that same integral.

140
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,930

141
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,050
So this is this formula that
Professor Jerison showed you

142
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,960
in class that bounds
the partial sums

143
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,440
in between the integral.

144
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,500
So here, where the integral,
instead of being an improper

145
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,690
integral, just goes
up to n plus 1.

146
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,530
So the integral test gives us,
it tells us that this diverges

147
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,640
if and only if this does, but
it also gives us explicit

148
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,780
bounds for those two
expressions, how they relate

149
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,360
to each other.

150
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,210
And so it says that the rate of
divergence of sN is very,

151
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,060
very closely tied
to the rate of

152
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,280
divergence of this integral.

153
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,020
Well, so what?

154
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,350
So OK.

155
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,840
So we said, we know, you
know, about how big

156
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,490
this integral is.

157
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,250
How big is it?

158
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,060
Well, we saw that
it's about log x

159
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,770
squared between the bounds.

160
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:14,180
So this is equal to, well, it's
about, it's 1/2 log of n

161
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:23,080
plus 1 squared minus 1/2 log 3
squared is less than sN, which

162
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,320
is less than log 3 over
3 plus the same thing.

163
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,160

164
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,550
So this is log n plus
1 quantity squared

165
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,050
minus 1/2 log 3 squared.

166
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,530
And here this is log n plus
1 quantity squared.

167
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,120
OK.

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
So this right, this right
hand side is equal to

169
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,390
this right hand side.

170
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,940
OK.

171
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,440
So we have that s--

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:03,050
and this is a big N. So we have
that sN is about bounded

173
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,360
by these-- sorry-- is definitely
bounded by these

174
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,030
two expressions.

175
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,450
Another thing to note is
that the constants

176
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,610
here are pretty small.

177
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:06,810
Right?

178
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,455
This 1/2 log 3 squared and log
3 over 3 times 1/2 log 3

179
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:12,820
squared, those are
pretty small.

180
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,810
From this point on in this
problem, I'm going to stop

181
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,360
worrying about precise constants
like that, and I'm

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,350
going to start using an
approximate sign.

183
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,270
So another way to write this
is to say that sN is

184
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,910
approximately--

185
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,210
so this is like an
equals sign, but

186
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,520
both of them are curvy.

187
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,980
So what I mean by
this, it doesn't

188
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,590
mean anything formally.

189
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,490
So it's not a precise meaning.

190
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,230
In this case, it's going
to mean always

191
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,290
about the same size.

192
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,190
For purposes of this argument,
it's going to

193
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,210
be about the same.

194
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,200
So this is about equal
to 1/2 ln of n

195
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,406
plus 1 quantity squared.

196
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,830

197
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,690
OK. and what we want, So OK.

198
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:53,860
So good.

199
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,940
So we have a good approximation
for about how

200
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,860
big the nth partial sum is.

201
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,580
Well, all right.

202
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,790
So why?

203
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,730
Well, because I know that what I
want to do is I want to keep

204
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,090
going until I reach a partial
sum that has size about 5,000.

205
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,250
So I want to know how,
many terms do I need.

206
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,790
Right?

207
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,100
That's going to tell me how much
time it requires, and I

208
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,860
need to know how many
terms there are.

209
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,350
So I need to know when sN is
about 5,000, how big is N?

210
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,460
So coming back over here, so I
need to take this equation,

211
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,760
and I need to solve it
for N in terms of sN.

212
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,550
Because I know that sN is going
to be about 5,000, so I

213
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,510
want to know, how big
is N going to be?

214
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:29,790
So OK.

215
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,340
So let's do that.

216
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,350
So we can multiply by 2,
take a square root, and

217
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,210
exponentiate.

218
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,220
And what we get--

219
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,370
so I'm going to move up here.

220
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,250

221
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:47,440
So from this expression, what
I get is that n plus 1 is

222
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,280
approximately equal to-- so I'm
going to multiply by 2,

223
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,160
take a square root, and
exponentiate, so that e to the

224
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,150
square root of 2 sN.

225
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,060

226
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,180
And you know what, I don't
care about this plus 1.

227
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,310
I'm going to forget about it.

228
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,290
So N is approximately equal to
e to the 2 square root of sN.

229
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,130
Now in our case, we want to know
particularly when sN is

230
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,760
equal to about 5,000.

231
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:27,150
So when sN is approximately
equal to 5,000, this means

232
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,020
that N is approximately--

233
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,090
well, 2 times 5,000 is 10,000,
square root of 10,000 is 100,

234
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,150
so N is approximately equal
to e to the 100.

235
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,040
Now e is between 2 and 3--

236
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,000
so OK, so you know, I don't,
I can't really give a very

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,100
precise estimate of this
off the top of my head.

238
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,080
But luckily I used a computer
ahead of time

239
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,400
to approximate it.

240
00:11:51,400 --> 00:12:02,260
So e to the 100 is about equal
to 2 times 10 to the

241
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,880
forty-third power.

242
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,220
So that's the number, so that's
about how big N is,

243
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,380
order of magnitude.

244
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,970
So we need to do about 2 times
10 to the forty-third terms.

245
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,550
So now that's the number of
terms. Now, if you remember,

246
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,190
back in our question, we were
asked, on the assumption that

247
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,420
each term takes 10 to the minus
20 seconds, how long is

248
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,070
this going to take.

249
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:47,690
So if each term requires 10 to
the minus 20 seconds, this

250
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,850
means we're dealing with 2 times
10 to the 23 seconds.

251
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,710
That's how long you'll
have to wait.

252
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,190
Now, this is a big number.

253
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,710
Right?

254
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,150
So let's think about how
big a number this is.

255
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,390
Because there are big numbers,
and then there are

256
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,220
ridiculously big numbers.

257
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,810
So, a big number would be a
number where like, maybe this

258
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,680
10 to the minus 20 is a
bad estimate, right?

259
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,890
I mean, maybe you are emperor
of the world, and you can

260
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,410
harness all the computing power
in the entire world to

261
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,470
work on this problem.

262
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,040
And so then, in that case, maybe
you can do, say, 10 to

263
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,940
the 25 computations per
second, something.

264
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,550
Or whatever.

265
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,480
So how much of a dent would
that make in this number?

266
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,580
Like 2 times 10 to 23.

267
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:37,760
OK.

268
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,110
It's not going to be done before
lunchtime, but how long

269
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,700
will it take?

270
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,950
So just to--

271
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,300
let's see.

272
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,860
I have this written down here.

273
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,330
OK.

274
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:55,940
So for comparison, this is about
equal to 50,000 times

275
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:04,010
the age of the universe.

276
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,680
So if you had, if you harnessed
all the computing

277
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
power on earth, you could
probably get this done in a

278
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,120
few billion years.

279
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,530
So OK, so just a sense
of just how slowly

280
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,410
this thing is getting.

281
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,740
If you wait, and you have all
the computer power on earth

282
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,400
adding terms of the series, in,
say, a few billion years

283
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,890
you will be able
to figure out--

284
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,470
you will sum up terms that
pass 5,000 in value.

285
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,390
So OK.

286
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,360
So I don't know.

287
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,790
I find that amusing.

288
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,530
And remember that the key here
to this whole problem was just

289
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,860
that we were using this
integral test here.

290
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,660
And specifically, we were using
in the form that I have

291
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,130
over here, this form that lets
you bound the partial sums

292
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,530
between two values
of the integral.

293
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,800
And because we have those
very tight bounds, these

294
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,160
approximations are all valid,
and so we can really say, yes,

295
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,270
this problem that I've described
is really something

296
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,990
you can't do in an afternoon
or whatever.

297
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,040
So I'll stop there.

298
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,314
