1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,362
Welcome back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:09,820
In this video I
want to talk to you

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,160
about another test
for convergence

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,174
we have for series,
that you haven't really

5
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:16,090
spent any time looking
at this particular one.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,410
And it's pretty
helpful, and also will

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,710
help us understand something
about Taylor series, which

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,200
I'll do in another video.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,090
So this is the ratio test.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,280
And you'll understand the name
of this test, momentarily.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,522
So we're going to start
with a series-- sorry--

12
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:36,210
we're going to start with a
series that we'll just say,

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,380
we'll call each term a sub n.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,010
And I'm not going to
tell you where n starts,

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,120
because it doesn't matter.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,744
It's really going to
only matter what's

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,725
happening out at infinity.

18
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,100
And to make things
simpler, we're

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,250
going to let all the
terms be positive.

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,726
OK?

21
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,100
You, if they're
not positive, you

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,080
can take the absolute
value of all the terms

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,440
and still make some
conclusions in terms

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,270
of absolute convergence.

25
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,670
So that's just a little sidebar.

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,260
But let's just deal with
all the terms positive,

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,390
so we don't have to
worry about anything.

28
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,310
And now, what does
the ratio test say?

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,090
Well, the ratio test
says that first, we

30
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,510
consider a certain ratio.

31
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,450
The limit as n goes to infinity
of a sub n plus 1 over a sub n.

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,950
OK?

33
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,380
So we consider this limit.

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,719
Well, that's your ratio.

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,510
What is this doing?

36
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,780
This is taking a term, and it's
dividing by the previous term.

37
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,000
You do that for all
of the values for n,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,450
as n goes to infinity,
and you look at the limit,

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,621
if it exists.

40
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:39,120
OK?

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,230
If the limit doesn't exist,
then you can't use this test.

42
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,780
So sometimes that will happen.

43
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,510
But if the limit exists,
you can use this test,

44
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,740
and you say it equals L.

45
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,360
And then you have the following
conclusions you can make.

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
So here are the conclusions.

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,180
There's three of them.

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,660
So if L is less than 1,
then the series converges.

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,020
OK?

50
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,040
That's nice.

51
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,965
That's good.

52
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:09,084
If L is bigger than 1,
the series diverges.

53
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,387
OK?

54
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:16,470
That's another good thing.

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,584
And then the last one
is, if L equals 1,

56
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:21,750
you can't conclude anything.

57
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,090
So I will try and
convince you of that fact

58
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,070
with a few examples later.

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,500
But let's look at this.

60
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,760
So you look at the ratio, and if
the ratio is less than 1, then

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,924
you actually can conclude
the series converges.

62
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,340
And if the ratio
is bigger than 1,

63
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,180
you can conclude that
the series diverges.

64
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,770
So let me just give you
a little understanding

65
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,180
of why this one
is true, and then

66
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,440
the same kind of logic can
be used for this second one.

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,980
So we'll try and understand
just at least a little bit

68
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,250
why, when L is less than
1, the series converges.

69
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,750
OK.

70
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,850
So let me just
start writing here.

71
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,950
So if L is less
than 1, then this

72
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,600
means that we have that a
sub n plus 1 over a sub n

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,180
as n goes to infinity is equal
to L, which is less than 1.

74
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,170
Right?

75
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,429
So we can pick something
between L and 1.

76
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,970
We can pick a number
between 1 and 1,

77
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,690
because L is
strictly less than 1.

78
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,030
And so what I'm going to
do, is I'm going to say,

79
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,610
I'm going to call this thing r.

80
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,100
Some number between L and 1.

81
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,002
OK?

82
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:28,960
So what does that mean?

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:36,200
That means that for large
n, we have a sub n plus 1

84
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,820
over a sub n-- sorry, that
looks like I'm adding 1

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,650
to the a sub n-- that's
a subscript-- a sub

86
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,870
n plus 1 over a sub n is
less than some fixed r.

87
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,720
So I'm picking a value
r between L and 1.

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,187
And then this is
true for all large N.

89
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,020
And when you're doing
math, sometimes people

90
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,790
say, for n, you
know, bigger than

91
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,500
or equal to some fixed value.

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,390
Basically, if you go far
enough out in the sequence,

93
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,910
then all the values bigger than
some fixed 1 have this ratio.

94
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,410
OK?

95
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,970
But let's get fancy with this.

96
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,600
This we can rewrite as r to
the n plus 1 over r to the n.

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,010
Right?

98
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,930
This is just r.

99
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,420
And now if I do a little
moving around, what do I see?

100
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,150
I see that a sub n plus
1 over r to the n plus 1

101
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,529
is less than a sub
n over r to the n.

102
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,570
Now, this might be weird.

103
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,970
What did I do?

104
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,678
I just multiplied
through by the a sub n,

105
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:30,610
and I divided by
the r sub n plus 1.

106
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,210
I get this thing, and then
I see that this ratio,

107
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,490
as n goes to infinity, the ratio
between a sub n and r to the n

108
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,470
is decreasing.

109
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,050
It's a decreasing, because
the next term, it's smaller.

110
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,610
Right?

111
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,640
And so the point is
that if I go far enough

112
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,240
out, if I start, say,
past this n naught,

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,130
if I go far enough
out, then I always have

114
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,800
that a sub n is less than some
constant times r to the n.

115
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,300
OK?

116
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,670
So this means-- this
implies-- a sub n is always

117
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,370
less than some constant
times r to the n.

118
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,960
Right?

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,220
And now, what do we do?

120
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,546
We do our comparison test.

121
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:10,045
OK?

122
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,440
We do our comparison test.

123
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,920
This is what's going to tell
us that the series converges.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,606
Now, again, this
isn't necessarily true

125
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:18,480
all the way through the
series, but it's true

126
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,520
when you're far enough
out, after this n naught.

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,800
And if a series
converges at the end,

128
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
the beginning is
just a finite sum.

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,103
So we don't have to
worry about what's

130
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,520
going on at the beginning.

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,250
So again, we're at this place.

132
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,130
We want to know what happens
to the sum of a sub n,

133
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,060
of all the terms a sub n.

134
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,880
Well, we know that's going to
be less than k times the sum

135
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,210
r to the n.

136
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,710
Right?

137
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,290
Because each a sub n is less
than some constant times r

138
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,690
to the n.

139
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,710
Now why does this converge
What do we know about r?

140
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,540
r we chose, we said
it's between L and 1.

141
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,750
In particular, it's less than 1.

142
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,660
This is a geometric series.

143
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,430
Geometric series, when r is less
than 1, we know it converges.

144
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,470
And so this one converges,
so then this one converges.

145
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,400
So that's the logic behind it.

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,060
We're going to now-- you know,
we're going to now use it.

147
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,630
But I want to point
out that if you

148
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,210
liked that, you can
come back over here,

149
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,990
and you can do the same
kind of reasoning for why,

150
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,820
if L is bigger than 1, a
sub n, the series, the sum

151
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,816
of the a sub n's diverges.

152
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,190
And that's going
to come down to,

153
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,750
now you choose an r
that's between L and 1,

154
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,820
but it has to be bigger than 1.

155
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,100
OK?

156
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,750
And then you can you
can look at that.

157
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,170
Or maybe r has to be bigger
than L. I didn't even

158
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,420
work that one out all the way.

159
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,650
But you can do it.

160
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,260
You put an r in there somewhere.

161
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,740
And the same kind of logic,
because the r will be bigger

162
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,990
than one, you're going
to get to a place

163
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,200
where probably the
inequality sign is going

164
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,890
to go the opposite way, right?

165
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,970
And then you'll have a
series that diverges,

166
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,120
and the other one will
be bigger than that one.

167
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,500
And so that's how the
logic is going to work.

168
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,000
So you have to figure
out where the r goes,

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,300
but I guarantee you'll
want the r bigger than 1.

170
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,109
And then you can, you'll have
to have the inequality signs

171
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:04,400
be opposite what they are here.

172
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,330
OK?

173
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,410
You'll see, they're going
to be opposite there.

174
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,950
OK.

175
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,440
Now let's get some examples.

176
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,610
Example 1.

177
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,760
Let's look at some
that we know, and then

178
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,480
let's look at some
that we don't know.

179
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,980
OK?

180
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,915
So let's look for example
first at 1 over n.

181
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,000
Alright?

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,230
Let's use the ratio
test on 1 over n.

183
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,840
Maybe this seems funny, 'cause
what do we know about it?

184
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,390
We know it diverges, right?

185
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,160
But let's check,
if this tells us.

186
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,870
The limit of n goes
to infinity of-- well,

187
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,150
what's the n plus
first term of this?

188
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,000
It's going to be
1 over n plus 1.

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,550
And what's the nth term of this?

190
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,480
It's going to be 1 over n.

191
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,650
And so we get,
it's the limit as n

192
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:03,070
goes to infinity of n over
n plus 1, and that equals 1.

193
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,430
Hmm.

194
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,800
So this one didn't work.

195
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,475
This one didn't
tell us anything.

196
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,560
And, OK.

197
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,650
But we know this one diverges.

198
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,150
So we know that-- this makes us
think, well, maybe when l is 1,

199
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,280
then we know it diverges.

200
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,470
But just to make sure we
don't make that conclusion,

201
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,580
we don't draw that conclusion,
let's look at 1 over n squared.

202
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,610
And what are the terms there?
a sub n plus 1 and a sub n.

203
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,280
The limit as n goes to infinity.

204
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,590
Well, the n plus first term
is going to be 1 over n

205
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,370
plus 1 quantity squared,
and the nth term

206
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,930
is going to be 1
over n squared, which

207
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,530
is going to be the limit as n
goes to infinity of n squared

208
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,040
over n plus 1 quantity squared,
which is also equal to 1.

209
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,900
And what do we know
about this one?

210
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,380
This one converges.

211
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,510
So this one gave us
the L is equal to 1,

212
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,810
but we know this one diverges.

213
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,020
And this one gave us L is equal
to 1, and we know it converges.

214
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,090
So we know that when L equals
1, we really cannot conclude

215
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,565
convergence or divergence.

216
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:05,065
OK?

217
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:08,000
L equals 1 doesn't let
us draw any conclusions.

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
But now let's see
something where, you know,

219
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,800
we can draw a
conclusion, because it

220
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,470
would be no fun if this
test never told us anything.

221
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,140
It probably wouldn't
be a test, then.

222
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,520
So let's try this one.

223
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,130
Let's try 4 to the n
over n times 3 to n.

224
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,080
Let's see what that one does.

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,580
All right?

226
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
So let's see.

227
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,480
What is, we need the limit
as n goes to infinity.

228
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,600
We need the n plus first term,
so let's plug in n plus 1

229
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,250
for all of these.

230
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,170
And I'm actually going to
do a little trick here,

231
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,970
and I'll explain it as I go.

232
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,310
4 to the n plus 1 over n
plus 1 3 to the n plus 1.

233
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,697
I'm going to multiply
by 1 over a sub n.

234
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,530
Because sometimes that's
a lot easier to do.

235
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,530
I could have done it on
these other ones, maybe,

236
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,420
but now I'm going to
do it on this one.

237
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,940
So this is actually
what the a sub

238
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,350
n is going to look like, right?

239
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,240
I had to put in n plus
1 to get a sub n plus 1.

240
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,640
This is a sub n.

241
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,020
I'm going to write
down 1 over a sub n,

242
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,770
and that's going to give me
n times 3 to the n over 4

243
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,250
to the n.

244
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,580
And now let's start simplifying.

245
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,030
I have 3 to the n over
3 to the n plus 1.

246
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,270
I'm left with just a 3 there.

247
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,580
4 to the n and 4
to the n plus 1.

248
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,311
I'm left with just a 4 there.

249
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,810
And now the limit as n goes to
infinity-- let's just rewrite

250
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,910
it so I know what it is.

251
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,350
Let's see.

252
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,170
I have 4n over 3 times n plus 1.

253
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,570
Well, the 4 and the 3 I
can actually just pull out.

254
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,470
But what did I have
here? n over n plus 1?

255
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,550
The limit of n goes to infinity
of that, that equals to 4/3.

256
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,130
That's bigger than 1.

257
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,955
So that actually diverges, OK?

258
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,960
And I have one more example,
and I'm almost out of space.

259
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,190
And let me actually come
over here and figure out

260
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,430
what example I wanted.

261
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,330
Ah.

262
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,140
Sorry about that.

263
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,770
I knew I had one more.

264
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,450
OK.

265
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,423
n to the tenth over 10 to the n.

266
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,506
So it's kind of interesting
one, because you have,

267
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:21,450
you have an exponential and
then you have a power of n.

268
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,990
So let's look at this one.

269
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,790
So we need to consider
limit as n goes to infinity.

270
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,520
So I put in n plus 1 first.

271
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,420
n plus 1 to the tenth
over 10 to the n plus 1.

272
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,260
And then I'm going to
just, remember, do times

273
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,750
1 over a sub n.

274
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,450
So I'm going to have 10 to
the n over n to the tenth.

275
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,530
So again, I took
a sub n, I did 1

276
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,770
over that, that's
just the reciprocal.

277
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,680
And now let's start dividing,
if I'm allowed to divide.

278
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,090
Yeah, I've got 10
to the n there,

279
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,420
and 10 to the n plus 1
there, so that gives me

280
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,690
a single 10 in the denominator.

281
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,640
And so now I really
have the limit

282
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,200
as n goes to infinity of
1 over 10 times n plus 1

283
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,734
to the tenth over
n to the tenth.

284
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:13,900
Well, that's equal to-- n
plus 1 to the tenth over n

285
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,441
to the tenth,

286
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,060
you might start to get nervous
and think, "Oh my gosh!

287
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,560
These powers are
getting really big!

288
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,790
It might make a difference
that that 1 is there."

289
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,570
It doesn't make a difference
that that 1 is there,

290
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,236
because if you actually
expand this out,

291
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,340
the leading term is
just n to the tenth.

292
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,975
And we know that the highest
order, or the highest degree

293
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,470
is going to win
out, so it's going

294
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,636
to be n to the tenth over
n to the tenth is how it's

295
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:35,920
going to behave in the limit.

296
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,000
So this part's just going
to go to 1, so I get 1/10.

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,321
Oh, that's less than 1!

298
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:40,820
Yay!

299
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,350
So this series converges.

300
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:48,120
OK?

301
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,170
So we had one that diverges,
one that converges,

302
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,620
and a few where we couldn't
get conclusions by this test.

303
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,800
And one point I want
to make about this,

304
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,440
is that in some cases, you
have the integral test already,

305
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,920
and sometimes that's
easy and that helps you.

306
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,580
In the case of
these examples where

307
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,390
we couldn't tell where
l was equal to 1,

308
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,630
the integral test is going
to tell you something.

309
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,470
But in this case, it's
a little bit harder

310
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,540
to deal with this,
as an integral test.

311
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,190
You can still do it, but
it's a little bit harder.

312
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,870
And so this, maybe,
is a little bit

313
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,020
quicker way to deal with these
types of, types of problems.

314
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,880
And the big thing
we're going to do,

315
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,505
is in the next video
on the ratio test,

316
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm going to show
you how you can

317
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,050
use this to determine
the radius of convergence

318
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,480
for these Taylor series.

319
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,830
So that's actually going
to be kind of exciting,

320
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,048
and that'll be in
our next video.
