9
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to continue our discussion

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
of methods of integration.
 

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
The method that I'm going to
describe today handles a

12
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
whole class of functions
of the following form.

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:45
You take P (x) / Q (x)
and this is known as

14
00:00:45 --> 00:00:53
a rational function.
 

15
00:00:53 --> 00:01:05
And all that means is that it's
a ratio off two polynomials,

16
00:01:05 --> 00:01:13
which are these functions
P ( x) and Q ( x).

17
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
We'll handle all such functions
by a method which is known

18
00:01:17 --> 00:01:26
as partial fractions.
 

19
00:01:26 --> 00:01:36
And what this does is, it
splits P / Q into what you

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:45
could call easier pieces.
 

21
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
So that's going to be
some kind of algebra.

22
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
And that's what we're going
to spend most of our

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
time doing today.
 

24
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
I'll start with an example.
 

25
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
And all of my examples
will be illustrating

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
more general methods.
 

27
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
The example is to integrate
the function 1 / x - 1

28
00:02:07 --> 00:02:15
+, say, 3 / x + 2 dx.
 

29
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
That's easy to do.
 

30
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
It's just, we already
know the answer.

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:26
It's ln x - 1 + 3 ln x + 3.
 

32
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
Plus a constant.
 

33
00:02:28 --> 00:02:37
So that's done.
 

34
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
So now, here's the difficulty
that is going to arise.

35
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
The difficulty is that I can
start with this function, which

36
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
is perfectly manageable.
 

37
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
And than I can add these
two functions together.

38
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
The way I add fractions.
 

39
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
So that's getting a
common denominator.

40
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
And so that gives me x
+ 2 here + 3 ( x - 1).

41
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
And now if I combine together
all of these terms, then

42
00:03:11 --> 00:03:16
altogether I have 4x
+ 2 - 3, that's - 1.

43
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
And if I multiply out the
denominator that's x ^2

44
00:03:20 --> 00:03:28
+ that 2 turned into a
3, that's interesting.

45
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Hope there aren't too many more
of those transformations.

46
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Is there another one here?
 

47
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

48
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
PROFESSOR: Oh, it
happened earlier on.

49
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Wow that's an interesting
vibration there.

50
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
OK.
 

51
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
Thank you.
 

52
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
So, I guess my 3's were
speaking to my 2's.

53
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
Somewhere in my past.
 

54
00:03:58 --> 00:04:07
OK, anyway, I think
this is now correct.

55
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
So the problem is
the following.

56
00:04:10 --> 00:04:11
This is the problem with this.
 

57
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
This integral was easy.
 

58
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
I'm calling it easy, we
already know how to do it.

59
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
Over here.
 

60
00:04:19 --> 00:04:28
But now over here,
it's disguised.

61
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
It's the same function,
but it's no longer clear

62
00:04:32 --> 00:04:32
how to integrate it.
 

63
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
If you're faced with this
one, you say what am

64
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
I supposed to do.
 

65
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
And we have to get
around that difficulty.

66
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
And so what we're going
to do is we're going to

67
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
unwind this disguise.
 

68
00:04:46 --> 00:04:55
So we have the algebra
problem that we have.

69
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
Oh, wow.
 

70
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
There must be something
in the water.

71
00:04:59 --> 00:05:06
Impressive.
 

72
00:05:06 --> 00:05:06
Wow.
 

73
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
OK, let's see.
 

74
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
Is 2/3 = 3/2?
 

75
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
Holy cow.
 

76
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
Well that's good.
 

77
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
Well, I'll keep you awake
today with several other

78
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
transpositions here.
 

79
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
So our algebra problem
is to detect the easy

80
00:05:29 --> 00:05:36
pieces which are inside.
 

81
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
And the method that we're going
to use, the one that we'll

82
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
emphasize anyway, is one
algebraic trick which is a

83
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
shortcut, which is called
the cover-up method.

84
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
But we're going to talk
about even more general

85
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
things than that.
 

86
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
But anyway, this is
where we're headed.

87
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
Is something called
the cover-up method.

88
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
Alright.
 

89
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
So that's our intro.
 

90
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
And I'll just have to
remember that 2 is not 3.

91
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
I'll keep on repeating that.
 

92
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
So now here I'm going to
describe to you how we

93
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
unwind this disguise.
 

94
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
The first step is, we write
down the function we

95
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
want to integrate.
 

96
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
Which was this.
 

97
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
And now we have to undo the
first damage that we did.

98
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
So the first step is to
factor the denominator.

99
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
And that factors, we happen to
know the factors, so I'm not

100
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
going to carry this out.
 

101
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
But this can be a
rather difficult step.

102
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
But we're going to
assume that it's done.

103
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
For the purposes of
illustration here.

104
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
So I factor the denominator.
 

105
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
And now, the second thing that
I'm going to do is what I'm

106
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
going to call the setup here.
 

107
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
How I'm going to set things up.
 

108
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
And I'll tell you what
these things are more

109
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
systematically in a second.
 

110
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
And the setup is that I
want to somehow detect

111
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
what I did before.
 

112
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
And I'm going to write
some unknowns here.

113
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
What I expect is that this will
break up into two pieces.

114
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
One with the denominator x
- 1, and the other with

115
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
the denominator x + 2.
 

116
00:07:23 --> 00:07:32
So now, my third step is going
to be to solve for A and B.

117
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
And then I'm done,
if I do that.

118
00:07:34 --> 00:07:41
That's the complete
unwinding of this disguise.

119
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
And this is where the cover-up
method comes in handy.

120
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
This is this method that
I'm about to describe.

121
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Now, you can do the algebra
in a clumsy way, or you

122
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
can do it in a quick way.
 

123
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
And we'd like to get efficient
about the algebra involved.

124
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
And so let me show you what the
first step in the trick is.

125
00:07:58 --> 00:08:12
We're going to solve for A
by multiplying by (x - 1).

126
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Now, notice if you multiply
by (x - 1) in that equation

127
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
2, what you get is this.
 

128
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
You got 4x - 2 / the
x - 1's cancel.

129
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
You get this on the
left-hand side.

130
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
And on the right-hand
side you get A.

131
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
The x - 1's cancel again.
 

132
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
And then we get
this extra term.

133
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
Which is B/ ( x + 2)( x - 1).
 

134
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
Now, the trick here, and we're
going to get even better

135
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
trick in just a second.
 

136
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
The trick here is that I
didn't try to clear the

137
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
denominators completely.
 

138
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
I was very efficient
about the way I did it.

139
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
It just cleared one factor.
 

140
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
And the result here
is very useful.

141
00:08:54 --> 00:09:03
Namely, if I plug in now x =
1, this term drops out too.

142
00:09:03 --> 00:09:10
So what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to plug in x = 1.

143
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
And what I get on the left-hand
side here is 4 - 1 and 1 + 2,

144
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
and on the left-hand
side I get A.

145
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
That's the end.
 

146
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
This is my formula for A.
 

147
00:09:21 --> 00:09:27
A happens to be equal to 1.
 

148
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
And that's, of course,
what I expect.

149
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
A had better be 1, because
the thing broke up into

150
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
1 / x - 1 + 3 / x + 2.
 

151
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
So this is the correct answer.
 

152
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
There was a question out
here, which I missed.

153
00:09:41 --> 00:09:48
STUDENT: Aren't polynomials
defined as functions with

154
00:09:48 --> 00:09:56
whole powers, or could
they be square roots?

155
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
PROFESSOR: Are polynomials
defined as functions with

156
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
whole powers, or can
they be square roots?

157
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
That's the question.
 

158
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
The answer is, they only
have whole powers.

159
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
So for instance here I only
have the power 1 and 0.

160
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
Here I have the powers 2, 1
and 0 in the denominator.

161
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
Square roots are no
good for this method.

162
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
Another question.
 

163
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

164
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
PROFESSOR: Why did I say x = 1?
 

165
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
The reason why I said x = 1 was
that it works really fast.

166
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
You can't know this in advance,
that's part of the method.

167
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
It just turns out to be
the best thing to do.

168
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
The fastest way of getting
at the coefficient A.

169
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
Now the curious thing,
let me just pause for a

170
00:10:38 --> 00:10:39
second before I do it.
 

171
00:10:39 --> 00:10:44
If I had plugged x = 1 into the
original equation, I would

172
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
have gotten nonsense.
 

173
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
Because I would've gotten
0 in the denominator.

174
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
And that seems like the
most horrible thing to do.

175
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
The worst possible thing
to do, is to set x = 1.

176
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
On the other hand, what
we did is a trick.

177
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
We multiplied by x - 1.
 

178
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
And that turned the
equation into this.

179
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
So now, in disguise,
I multiplied by 0.

180
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
But that turns out
to be legitimate.

181
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
Because really this equation
is true for all x except 1.

182
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
And then instead of taking
x = 1, I can really

183
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
take x tends to 1.
 

184
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
That's really what I need.
 

185
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
The limit is x goes to one.
 

186
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
The equation is
still valid then.

187
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
So I'm using the worst case,
the case that looks like

188
00:11:23 --> 00:11:24
it's dividing by 0.
 

189
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
And it's helping me because
it's cancelling out all the

190
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
information in terms of B.
 

191
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
So the advantage here is
this cancellation that

192
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
occurs in this part.
 

193
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
So that's the method.
 

194
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
We're going to shorten it
much, much more in a second.

195
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
But let me carry it out for the
other coefficient as well.

196
00:11:44 --> 00:11:51
So the other coefficient I'm
going to solve for B, I'm

197
00:11:51 --> 00:11:57
going to multiply by x + 2.
 

198
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
And when I do that, I get 4x -
1 / x - 1, that's the left-hand

199
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
side, the very top
expression there.

200
00:12:05 --> 00:12:10
And then down below I get
A/ ( x - 1)( x + 2).

201
00:12:10 --> 00:12:14
And then again the
x + 2's cancel.

202
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
So I get B sitting alone.
 

203
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
And now I'm going to
do the same trick.

204
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
I'm going to set x = - 2.
 

205
00:12:21 --> 00:12:28
That's the value which is going
to knock out this A term here.

206
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
So that cancels this
term completely.

207
00:12:30 --> 00:12:37
And what we get here all told
is - 8 - 1 / - 2 - 1 = B.

208
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
In other words, B = 3,
which was also what it

209
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
was supposed to be.
 

210
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
B was this number
3, right here.

211
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
Which I'm now not
going to change to 2.

212
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Because I know that it's not 2.
 

213
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
There was a question.
 

214
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

215
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

216
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
Now, this is the method
which is called cover-up.

217
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
But it's really carried out
much, much faster than this.

218
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
So I'm going to review the
method and I'm going to show

219
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
you what it is in general.
 

220
00:13:14 --> 00:13:22
So the first step is to
factor the denominator, Q.

221
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
That's what I labeled
1 over there.

222
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
That was the factorization
of the denominator up top.

223
00:13:29 --> 00:13:36
The second step is what I'm
going to call the setup.

224
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
That's step 2.
 

225
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
And that's where I knew what
I was aiming for in advance.

226
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
And I'm going to have to
explain to you in every

227
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
instance exactly what
this setup should be.

228
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
That is, what the unknowns
should be and what target,

229
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
simplified expression,
we're aiming for.

230
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
So that's the setup.
 

231
00:13:54 --> 00:14:01
And then the third step is
what I'll now call cover-up.

232
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Which is just a very fast way
of doing what I did on this

233
00:14:04 --> 00:14:09
last board, which is solving
for the unknown coefficients.

234
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
So now, let me perform
it for you again.

235
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Over here.
 

236
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
So it's 4x - 1 divided by,
so this is to eliminate

237
00:14:18 --> 00:14:19
writing here.
 

238
00:14:19 --> 00:14:24
Handwriting it makes
it much faster.

239
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
So this part just factoring
the denominator, that

240
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
was 1, that was step 1.
 

241
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
And then step 2, again,
is the setup, which is

242
00:14:34 --> 00:14:39
setting it up like this.
 

243
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
Alright, that's the setup.
 

244
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
And now I claim that without
writing very much, I can

245
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
figure out what A and B are.
 

246
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Just by staring at this.
 

247
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
So now what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to think

248
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
what I did over there.
 

249
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
And I'm just going
to do it directly.

250
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
So let me show you what the
method consists of visually.

251
00:15:02 --> 00:15:09
I'm going to cover up, that is,
knock out this factor, and

252
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
focus on this number here.
 

253
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
And I'm going to plug in
the thing that makes

254
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
the 0, which is x = 1.
 

255
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
So I'm plugging in x = 1.
 

256
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
To this left-hand side.
 

257
00:15:21 --> 00:15:28
And what I get is 4
- 1 / 1 + 2 = A.

258
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
Now, that's the same
thing I did over there.

259
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
I just did it by skipping the
intermediate algebra step,

260
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
which is a lot of writing.
 

261
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
So the cover-up method really
amounts to the following thing.

262
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
I'm thinking of multiplying
this over here.

263
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
It cancels this and it gets
rid of everything else.

264
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
And it just leaves me with
A on the right-hand side.

265
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
And I have to get rid
of it on this side.

266
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
So in other words, by
eliminating this, I'm isolating

267
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
a on the right-hand side.
 

268
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
So the cover-up is that
I'm covering this and

269
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
getting A out of it.
 

270
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
Similarly, I can do the
same thing with B.

271
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
It's focused on the
value x = - 2.

272
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
And b is what I'm getting
on the right-hand side.

273
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
And then I have to
cover up this.

274
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
So if I cover up that, then
what's left over with x = - 2

275
00:16:14 --> 00:16:22
is again, - 8 - 1 / - 2 - 1.
 

276
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
So this is the way the method
gets carried out in practice.

277
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32
Writing, essentially,
the least you can.

278
00:16:32 --> 00:16:40
Now, when you get to several
variables, it becomes just way

279
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
more convenient to do this.
 

280
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
So now, let me just review
when cover-up works.

281
00:16:45 --> 00:17:00
So this cover-up method works
if Q ( x) has distinct

282
00:17:00 --> 00:17:06
linear factors.
 

283
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
And, so you need
two things here.

284
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
It has to factor completely,
the denominator has

285
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
to factor completely.
 

286
00:17:15 --> 00:17:21
And the degree of the numerator
has to be strictly less than

287
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
the degree of the denominator.
 

288
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
I'm going to give you
an example here.

289
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
So, for instance, and this
tells you the general

290
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
pattern of the setup also.
 

291
00:17:38 --> 00:17:44
Say you had x ^2 +
3x + 8, let's say.

292
00:17:44 --> 00:17:50
Over (x - 1) ( x - 2)( x + 5).
 

293
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
So here I'm going to
tell you the setup.

294
00:17:52 --> 00:18:02
The setup is going to be A / (x
- 1) + B / (x - 2) + c / x + 5.

295
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
And it will always break
up into something.

296
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
So however many factors you
have, you'll have to put in

297
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
a term for each of those.
 

298
00:18:09 --> 00:18:13
And then you can find
each number here by

299
00:18:13 --> 00:18:26
this cover-up method.
 

300
00:18:26 --> 00:18:29
Now we're done with that.
 

301
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
And now we have to go on to
the algebraic complications.

302
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
So would the first typical
algebraic complication be.

303
00:18:38 --> 00:18:50
It would be repeated roots
or repeated factors.

304
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
Let me get one that
doesn't come out to be

305
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
extremely ugly here.
 

306
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
So this is what we'll
call Example 2.

307
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
And this is going to work when
the degree, you always need

308
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
that the degree of the
numerator is less than the

309
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
degree of the denominator.
 

310
00:19:12 --> 00:19:22
And Q has now repeated
linear factors.

311
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
So let's see which example
I wanted to show you.

312
00:19:26 --> 00:19:28
So let's just give this here.
 

313
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
I'll just repeat
the denominator.

314
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
With an extra factor like this.
 

315
00:19:39 --> 00:19:41
Now, the main thing you
need to know, since I've

316
00:19:41 --> 00:19:44
already performed the
factorization for you.

317
00:19:44 --> 00:19:46
Already performed Step 1.
 

318
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
This is Step 1 here.
 

319
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
You have to factor things
all the way, and that's

320
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
already been done for you.
 

321
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
And here's what this setup is.
 

322
00:19:56 --> 00:20:00
The setup is that it's
of the form A / (x -

323
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
1) + B / (x - 1) ^2.
 

324
00:20:05 --> 00:20:15
We need another term for the
square here. + C / (x + 2).

325
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
In general, if you have more
powers you just need to keep

326
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
on putting in those powers.
 

327
00:20:19 --> 00:20:24
You need one for
each of the powers.

328
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
Why does it have to be squared?
 

329
00:20:26 --> 00:20:27
OK.
 

330
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
Good question.
 

331
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
So why in the world
am I doing this?

332
00:20:31 --> 00:20:37
Let me just give you one hint
as to why I'm doing this.

333
00:20:37 --> 00:20:40
It's very, very much like
the decimal expansion of a

334
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
number or, say, the base
2 expansion of a number.

335
00:20:44 --> 00:20:57
So, for, example the number
7/16 is 0 / 2 + 1 / 2 ^2 +

336
00:20:57 --> 00:21:02
1/2 ^3 +, is that right?
 

337
00:21:02 --> 00:21:07
So it's 4/16 + 1/2 ^4.
 

338
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
It's this sort of thing.
 

339
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
And I'm getting this
power and this power.

340
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
If I have higher powers,
I'm going to have to

341
00:21:13 --> 00:21:14
have more and more.
 

342
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
So this is what happens
when I have a 2 ^ 4.

343
00:21:17 --> 00:21:20
I have to represent
things like this.

344
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
That's what's coming
out of this piece with

345
00:21:23 --> 00:21:24
the repetitious here.
 

346
00:21:24 --> 00:21:26
Of the powers.
 

347
00:21:26 --> 00:21:31
This is just an analogy.
 

348
00:21:31 --> 00:21:31
Of what we're doing.
 

349
00:21:31 --> 00:21:33
Yeah, another
question over here.

350
00:21:33 --> 00:21:34
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

351
00:21:34 --> 00:21:35
PROFESSOR: Yes.
 

352
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
So this is an example, but it's
meant to represent the general

353
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
case and I will also give
you a general picture.

354
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
For sure, once you have the
second power here, you'll need

355
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
both the first and the second
power mentioned over here.

356
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
And since there's only a first
power over here I only have

357
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
to mention a first
power over there.

358
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
If this were a 3 here, there
would be one more term which

359
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
would be the one for x -
1 ^2 in the denominator.

360
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
That's what you just said.
 

361
00:22:03 --> 00:22:09
OK, now, what's different about
this setup is that the cover-up

362
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
method, although it works,
it doesn't work so well.

363
00:22:13 --> 00:22:14
It doesn't work quite as well.
 

364
00:22:14 --> 00:22:33
The cover-up works for the
coefficients B and C, not A.

365
00:22:33 --> 00:22:38
We'll have a quick method
for the numbers B and C.

366
00:22:38 --> 00:22:40
To figure out what they are.
 

367
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
But it will be a little
slower to get to A,

368
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
which we will do last.
 

369
00:22:47 --> 00:22:56
Let me show you how it works.
 

370
00:22:56 --> 00:23:01
First of all, I'm going to do
the ordinary cover-up with C.

371
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
So for C, I just want to
do the same old thing

372
00:23:05 --> 00:23:06
that I did before.
 

373
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
I cover up this, and that's
going to get rid of all the

374
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
junk except for the C term.
 

375
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
So I have to plug x = - 2.
 

376
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
And I get x -- sorry, I get (-2
) ^2 + 2 in the numerator.

377
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
And I get (- 2 - 1)^2
in the denominator.

378
00:23:25 --> 00:23:28
Remember I'm covering this up.
 

379
00:23:28 --> 00:23:30
So that's all there is
on the left-hand side.

380
00:23:30 --> 00:23:37
And on the right-hand
side all there is C.

381
00:23:37 --> 00:23:39
Everything else got killed
off, because it was

382
00:23:39 --> 00:23:40
x - 2 times that.
 

383
00:23:40 --> 00:23:42
That's 0 times all
that other stuff.

384
00:23:42 --> 00:23:45
And the x - 2 over
here canceled.

385
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
This is the shortcut that I
just described, and this is

386
00:23:47 --> 00:23:50
much faster than doing
all that arithmetic.

387
00:23:50 --> 00:23:52
And algebra.
 

388
00:23:52 --> 00:23:57
So all together this
is a 6/9, right?

389
00:23:57 --> 00:24:09
So it's C = 6/9, which is 2/3.
 

390
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
Now, the other one which is
easy to do, I'm going to do

391
00:24:13 --> 00:24:14
by the slow method first.
 

392
00:24:14 --> 00:24:17
But you omit a term.
 

393
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
The idea is to cover up
the other bad factor.

394
00:24:23 --> 00:24:27
Cover ups, I'll do it both
the way and the slow way.

395
00:24:27 --> 00:24:29
I'll do it the fast way
first, and then I'll

396
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
show you the slow way.
 

397
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
The fast way is to
cover this up.

398
00:24:32 --> 00:24:34
And then I have to cover
up everything else.

399
00:24:34 --> 00:24:35
That gets eliminated.
 

400
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
And that includes
everything but B.

401
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
So I get B on this side.
 

402
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
And I get 1 on that side.
 

403
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
So that's 1 ^2 + 2 / 1 + 2.
 

404
00:24:48 --> 00:24:56
So in other words, B = 1.
 

405
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
That was pretty fast, so let
me show you what arithmetic

406
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
was hiding behind that.
 

407
00:25:00 --> 00:25:01
What algebra was
hiding behind it.

408
00:25:01 --> 00:25:06
What I was really
doing is this.

409
00:25:06 --> 00:25:16
In multiplying through by
x - 1 ^2, so I got this.

410
00:25:16 --> 00:25:19
So this canceled here, so
this C just stands alone.

411
00:25:19 --> 00:25:26
And then I have here
C /x + 2 (x - 1) ^2.

412
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
Notice again, I cleared out
that 1, this term from the

413
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
denominator and sent it
over to the other side.

414
00:25:33 --> 00:25:38
Now, what's happening is
that when I set x = 1

415
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
here, this term is dying.
 

416
00:25:43 --> 00:25:45
This term is going away,
because there's more powers

417
00:25:45 --> 00:25:47
in the numerator than
in the denominator.

418
00:25:47 --> 00:25:50
This is still 0.
 

419
00:25:50 --> 00:25:52
And this one is gone also.
 

420
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
So all that's left is B.
 

421
00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
Now, I cannot pull that off
with a single power of x - 1.

422
00:25:59 --> 00:26:02
I can't expose the A term.
 

423
00:26:02 --> 00:26:04
It's the B term
that I can expose.

424
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
Because I can multiply through
by this thing squared.

425
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
If I multiply through by just x
- 1, what'll happen here is I

426
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
won't have canceled
this (x - 1 )^2.

427
00:26:12 --> 00:26:13
It's useless.
 

428
00:26:13 --> 00:26:15
I still have a 0 in
the denominator.

429
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
I'll have B / 0 when
I plug in x = 1.

430
00:26:17 --> 00:26:22
Which I can't use.
 

431
00:26:22 --> 00:26:32
Again, the cover-up method is
giving us B and C, not A.

432
00:26:32 --> 00:26:38
Now, for the last term, for A,
I'm going to just have to be

433
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
straightforward about it.
 

434
00:26:40 --> 00:26:51
And so I'll just suggest for A,
plug in your favorite number.

435
00:26:51 --> 00:26:59
So plug in my favorite number.
 

436
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
Which is x = 0.
 

437
00:27:01 --> 00:27:04
And you won't be able to
plug in x = 0 if you've

438
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
already used it.
 

439
00:27:05 --> 00:27:08
Here the two numbers
we've already used are

440
00:27:08 --> 00:27:13
x = 1 and x = - 2.
 

441
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
But we haven't used x =
0 yet, so that's good.

442
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
I'm going to plug in now
x = 0 into the equation.

443
00:27:21 --> 00:27:22
What do I get?
 

444
00:27:22 --> 00:27:35
I get 0 ^2 + 2 / (- 1) ^2 *
2 is equal to, let's see.

445
00:27:35 --> 00:27:36
A is the thing that
I don't know.

446
00:27:36 --> 00:27:44
So it's A / - 1 +, B /
x - 1 ^2 so B = 1, so

447
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
that's 1 / (- 1) ^2.
 

448
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
And then C was 2/3.
 

449
00:27:51 --> 00:27:55
2/3 / x + 2.
 

450
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
So that's 0 + 2.
 

451
00:28:00 --> 00:28:02
Don't give up at this point.
 

452
00:28:02 --> 00:28:03
This is a lot of algebra.
 

453
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
You really have to plug
in all these numbers.

454
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
You make one arithmetic mistake
and you're always going

455
00:28:08 --> 00:28:09
to get the wrong answer.
 

456
00:28:09 --> 00:28:16
This is very
arithmetically intensive.

457
00:28:16 --> 00:28:18
However, it does
simplify at this point.

458
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
We have 2 / 2, that's 1.
 

459
00:28:22 --> 00:28:27
Is equal to - A + 1 + 1/3.
 

460
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
So let's see.
 

461
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
A on the other side,
this becomes A = 1/3.

462
00:28:34 --> 00:28:35
And that's it.
 

463
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
This is the end.
 

464
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
We've we've simplified
our function.

465
00:28:40 --> 00:28:48
And now it's easy to integrate.
 

466
00:28:48 --> 00:28:48
Question.
 

467
00:28:48 --> 00:28:49
Another question.
 

468
00:28:49 --> 00:29:02
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

469
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, if x = 0 has already

470
00:29:04 --> 00:29:05
been used, what do I do?
 

471
00:29:05 --> 00:29:10
And the answer is,
pick something else.

472
00:29:10 --> 00:29:11
And you said pick
a random number.

473
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
And that's right, except that
if you really picked a random

474
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
number it would be 4.12567843,
which would be difficult.

475
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
What you want to pick is the
easiest possible number

476
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
you can think of.
 

477
00:29:24 --> 00:29:24
Yeah.
 

478
00:29:24 --> 00:29:32
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

479
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
PROFESSOR: If you had, as in
this sort of situation here.

480
00:29:37 --> 00:29:39
More powers.
 

481
00:29:39 --> 00:29:41
Wouldn't you have
more variables.

482
00:29:41 --> 00:29:42
Very good question.
 

483
00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
That's absolutely right.
 

484
00:29:44 --> 00:29:48
This was a 3 by 3 system in
disguise, for these three

485
00:29:48 --> 00:29:50
unknowns, A, B and C.
 

486
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
What we started with in
the previous problem

487
00:29:52 --> 00:29:53
was two variables.
 

488
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
It's over here, the
variables A and B.

489
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
And as the degree of the
denominator goes up, the

490
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
number of variables goes up.
 

491
00:30:02 --> 00:30:05
It gets more and more
and more complicated.

492
00:30:05 --> 00:30:06
More and more
arithmetically intensive.

493
00:30:06 --> 00:30:09
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

494
00:30:09 --> 00:30:09
PROFESSOR: Well, so.
 

495
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
The question is, how would
you solve it if you

496
00:30:11 --> 00:30:12
have two unknowns.
 

497
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
That's exactly the point here.
 

498
00:30:16 --> 00:30:19
This is a system of
simultaneous equations

499
00:30:19 --> 00:30:19
for unknowns.
 

500
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
And we have little tricks for
isolating single variables.

501
00:30:23 --> 00:30:25
Otherwise we're stuck with
solving the whole system.

502
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
And you'd have to solve the
whole system by elimination,

503
00:30:28 --> 00:30:35
various other tricks.
 

504
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
I'll say a little more
about that later.

505
00:30:38 --> 00:30:47
Now, I have to get one step
more complicated with

506
00:30:47 --> 00:30:53
my next example.
 

507
00:30:53 --> 00:31:02
My next example is going to
have a quadratic factor.

508
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
So still I'm sticking to the
degree of the polynomial and

509
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
the numerator is less than
the degree of the polynomial

510
00:31:08 --> 00:31:09
in the denominator.
 

511
00:31:09 --> 00:31:21
And I'm going to take the case
where Q has a quadratic factor.

512
00:31:21 --> 00:31:26
Let me just again illustrate
this by example.

513
00:31:26 --> 00:31:30
I have here (x - 1) (x^2 + 1).
 

514
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
I'll make it about as
easy as they come.

515
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
Now, the setup will be
slightly different here.

516
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
Here's the setup.
 

517
00:31:40 --> 00:31:42
It's already factored.
 

518
00:31:42 --> 00:31:44
I've already done as
much as I can do.

519
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
I can't factor this x^2 + 1
into linear factors unless you

520
00:31:48 --> 00:31:49
know about complex numbers.
 

521
00:31:49 --> 00:31:52
If you know about complex
numbers this method

522
00:31:52 --> 00:31:53
becomes much easier.
 

523
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
And it comes back to
the cover-up method.

524
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
Which is the way that the
cover-up method was originally

525
00:31:58 --> 00:32:01
conceived by heavy side.
 

526
00:32:01 --> 00:32:04
But you won't get to
that until 18.03.

527
00:32:04 --> 00:32:05
So we'll wait.
 

528
00:32:05 --> 00:32:08
This, by the way, is a method
which is used for integration.

529
00:32:08 --> 00:32:11
But it was invented to do
something with Laplace

530
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
transforms and inversion
of certain kinds of

531
00:32:14 --> 00:32:15
differential equations.
 

532
00:32:15 --> 00:32:17
By heavy side.
 

533
00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
And so it came much
later than integration.

534
00:32:21 --> 00:32:26
But anyway, it's a very
convenient method.

535
00:32:26 --> 00:32:30
So here's the set
up with this one.

536
00:32:30 --> 00:32:34
Again, we want a term for
this (x - 1) factor.

537
00:32:34 --> 00:32:36
And now we're going to also
have a term with the

538
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
denominator x squared plus 1.
 

539
00:32:39 --> 00:32:40
But this is the difference.
 

540
00:32:40 --> 00:32:44
It's now going to be a
first degree polynomial.

541
00:32:44 --> 00:32:53
One degree down from
the quadratic here.

542
00:32:53 --> 00:32:55
So this is what I keep
on calling the setup,

543
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
this is number 2.
 

544
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
You have to know that in
advance based on the pattern

545
00:32:59 --> 00:33:03
that you see on the
left-hand side.

546
00:33:03 --> 00:33:03
Yes.
 

547
00:33:03 --> 00:33:13
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

548
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
PROFESSOR: The question is, if
the degree of the numerator.

549
00:33:15 --> 00:33:19
So in this case, if this were
cubed, and this is matching

550
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
with the denominator, which
is total of degree 3.

551
00:33:23 --> 00:33:26
The answer is that
this does not work.

552
00:33:26 --> 00:33:29
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

553
00:33:29 --> 00:33:31
PROFESSOR: It definitely
doesn't work.

554
00:33:31 --> 00:33:32
And we're going to have
to do something totally

555
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
different to handle it.
 

556
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
Which turns out, fortunately,
to be much easier than this.

557
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
But we'll deal with
that at the end.

558
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
Keep this in mind.
 

559
00:33:43 --> 00:33:45
This is an easy way to make
a mistake if you start with

560
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
a higher degree numerator.
 

561
00:33:47 --> 00:33:51
You'll never get
the right answer.

562
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
So now, so I have my setup now.
 

563
00:33:54 --> 00:33:56
And now what can I do?
 

564
00:33:56 --> 00:34:03
Well, I claim that I can
still do cover-up for A.

565
00:34:03 --> 00:34:05
It's the same idea.
 

566
00:34:05 --> 00:34:07
I cover this guy up.
 

567
00:34:07 --> 00:34:09
And if I really multiply
by it it would knock

568
00:34:09 --> 00:34:11
everything out but A.
 

569
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
So I cover this up
and I plug in x = 1.

570
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
So I get here 1 ^2
/ 1 ^2 + 1 = A.

571
00:34:20 --> 00:34:25
In other words, A = 1/2.
 

572
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
Again cover-up is pretty
fast, as you can see.

573
00:34:28 --> 00:34:32
It's not too bad.
 

574
00:34:32 --> 00:34:41
Now, at this next stage,
I want to find B and C.

575
00:34:41 --> 00:34:45
And the best idea
is the slow way.

576
00:34:45 --> 00:34:48
Here, it's not too terrible.
 

577
00:34:48 --> 00:34:50
But it's just what
we're going to do.

578
00:34:50 --> 00:34:54
Which is to clear the
denominators completely.

579
00:34:54 --> 00:35:05
So for B and C, just
clear the denominator.

580
00:35:05 --> 00:35:08
That means multiply through
by that whole business.

581
00:35:08 --> 00:35:09
Now, when you do that on
the left-hand side you're

582
00:35:09 --> 00:35:10
going to get x ^2.
 

583
00:35:10 --> 00:35:12
Because I got rid of
the whole denominator.

584
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
On the right-hand side when
I bring this up, the x -

585
00:35:16 --> 00:35:18
1 will cancel with this.
 

586
00:35:18 --> 00:35:23
So the a term will
be A ( x ^2 + 1).

587
00:35:23 --> 00:35:29
And the Bx + C term will have
a remaining factor of x - 1.

588
00:35:29 --> 00:35:33
Because the x ^2
+ 1 will cancel.

589
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
Again, the arithmetic here
is not too terrible.

590
00:35:38 --> 00:35:41
Now I'm going to
do the following.

591
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
I'm going to look
at the x ^2 term.

592
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
On the left-hand side and
the right-hand side.

593
00:35:49 --> 00:35:51
And that will give me one
equation for B and C.

594
00:35:51 --> 00:35:54
And then I'm going to do the
same thing with another term.

595
00:35:54 --> 00:35:57
The x^2 term on the left-hand
side, the coefficient is 1.

596
00:35:57 --> 00:35:59
It's 1 ( x ^2).
 

597
00:35:59 --> 00:36:06
On the other side, it's A.
remember I actually have A.

598
00:36:06 --> 00:36:08
So I'm going to put
it in, it's 1/2.

599
00:36:08 --> 00:36:11
So this is the A term.
 

600
00:36:11 --> 00:36:14
And so I get 1/2 ( x ^2).
 

601
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
And then the only other x^2 is
when this Bx multiplies this x.

602
00:36:18 --> 00:36:23
So Bx * x is Bx ^2, so this
is the other coefficient

603
00:36:23 --> 00:36:25
on x ^2 is B.
 

604
00:36:25 --> 00:36:36
And that forces B to be 1/2.
 

605
00:36:36 --> 00:36:41
And last of all, I'm going
to do the x^ 0 power term.

606
00:36:41 --> 00:36:44
Or, otherwise known as
the constant term.

607
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
And on the left-hand side,
the constant term is 0.

608
00:36:48 --> 00:36:51
There is no constant term.
 

609
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57
On the right-hand side there's
a constant term, 1/2 * 1.

610
00:36:57 --> 00:36:58
That's 1/2 here.
 

611
00:36:58 --> 00:37:01
And then there's another
constant term, which is this

612
00:37:01 --> 00:37:03
constant times this - 1.
 

613
00:37:03 --> 00:37:09
Which is - C.
 

614
00:37:09 --> 00:37:18
And so the conclusion
here is that C = 1/2.

615
00:37:18 --> 00:37:18
Another question.
 

616
00:37:18 --> 00:37:19
Yeah.
 

617
00:37:19 --> 00:37:33
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

618
00:37:33 --> 00:37:37
PROFESSOR: There's also an
x^ 0 power hidden in here.

619
00:37:37 --> 00:37:40
Sorry, an x ^ 1 , that's what
you were asking about, sorry.

620
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42
There's also an x ^ 1 .
 

621
00:37:42 --> 00:37:45
The only reason why I didn't go
to the x^ 1 is that it turns

622
00:37:45 --> 00:37:49
out with these two
I didn't need it.

623
00:37:49 --> 00:37:51
The other thing is that by
experience, I know that the

624
00:37:51 --> 00:37:53
extreme ends of the
multiplication are

625
00:37:53 --> 00:37:54
the easiest ends.
 

626
00:37:54 --> 00:37:57
And the middle terms have
tons of cross terms.

627
00:37:57 --> 00:37:59
And so I don't like the middle
term as much because it always

628
00:37:59 --> 00:38:01
involves more arithmetic.
 

629
00:38:01 --> 00:38:05
So I stick to the lowest and
the highest terms if I can.

630
00:38:05 --> 00:38:07
So that was really
a sneaky thing.

631
00:38:07 --> 00:38:10
I did that without
saying anything.

632
00:38:10 --> 00:38:10
Yes.
 

633
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

634
00:38:14 --> 00:38:15
PROFESSOR: Another
good question.

635
00:38:15 --> 00:38:17
Could I just set equals 0?
 

636
00:38:17 --> 00:38:17
Absolutely.
 

637
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
In fact, that's equivalent to
picking out the x^ 0 term.

638
00:38:22 --> 00:38:24
And you could plug in numbers.
 

639
00:38:24 --> 00:38:25
If you wanted.
 

640
00:38:25 --> 00:38:27
That's another way of doing
this besides doing that.

641
00:38:27 --> 00:38:30
So you can also
plug in numbers.

642
00:38:30 --> 00:38:38
Can plug in numbers. x = 0.
 

643
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
Actually, not x = 1,
right? - 1, 2, etc.

644
00:38:44 --> 00:38:46
Not 1 just because
we've already used it.

645
00:38:46 --> 00:38:48
We won't get interesting
information out.

646
00:38:48 --> 00:38:48
Yes.
 

647
00:38:48 --> 00:38:56
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

648
00:38:56 --> 00:38:58
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, could I have done

649
00:38:58 --> 00:38:59
it this other way.
 

650
00:38:59 --> 00:39:02
With the polynomial,
with this other one.

651
00:39:02 --> 00:39:04
Yes, absolutely.
 

652
00:39:04 --> 00:39:07
So in other words what I've
taught you now is two choices

653
00:39:07 --> 00:39:09
which are equally reasonable.
 

654
00:39:09 --> 00:39:12
The one that I picked was the
one that was the fastest for

655
00:39:12 --> 00:39:15
this guy and the one that was
fastest for this one, but I

656
00:39:15 --> 00:39:19
could've done the
other way around.

657
00:39:19 --> 00:39:22
There are a lot of ways of
solving simultaneous equations.

658
00:39:22 --> 00:39:23
Yeah, another question.
 

659
00:39:23 --> 00:39:24
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

660
00:39:24 --> 00:39:25
PROFESSOR: The question
is the following.

661
00:39:25 --> 00:39:28
So now everybody can
understand the question.

662
00:39:28 --> 00:39:33
If this, instead of being x
^2 + 1, this were x^3 + 1.

663
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
So that's an important
case to understand.

664
00:39:36 --> 00:39:39
That's a case in which
this denominator is

665
00:39:39 --> 00:39:41
not fully factored.
 

666
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
So it's an x^3 + 1, you would
have to factor out an x + 1.

667
00:39:46 --> 00:39:49
So that would be a situation
like this, you have an x^3 + 1,

668
00:39:49 --> 00:39:57
but that's (x + 1)( x^2 + x
+ 1), this kind of thing.

669
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
If that's the right, there must
be a minus sign in here maybe.

670
00:40:01 --> 00:40:03
OK, something like this.
 

671
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
Right?
 

672
00:40:07 --> 00:40:08
Isn't that what it is?
 

673
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

674
00:40:12 --> 00:40:12
PROFESSOR: I think it's right.
 

675
00:40:12 --> 00:40:15
But anyway, the point is
that you have to factor it.

676
00:40:15 --> 00:40:17
And then you have a
linear and a quadratic.

677
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
So you're always going to be
faced eventually with linear

678
00:40:21 --> 00:40:23
factors and quadratic factors.
 

679
00:40:23 --> 00:40:25
If you have a cubic,
that means you haven't

680
00:40:25 --> 00:40:28
factored sufficiently.
 

681
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
So you're still back in Step 1.
 

682
00:40:32 --> 00:40:32
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

683
00:40:32 --> 00:40:34
PROFESSOR: In the x^3 + 1 case?
 

684
00:40:34 --> 00:40:36
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

685
00:40:36 --> 00:40:39
PROFESSOR: In the x^3 + 1 case,
we are out of luck until we've

686
00:40:39 --> 00:40:41
completed the factorization.
 

687
00:40:41 --> 00:40:44
Once we've completed the
factorization, we're going to

688
00:40:44 --> 00:40:48
have to deal with these two
factors as denominators.

689
00:40:48 --> 00:40:54
So it'll be this plus something
over x + 1 + a Bx + C type of

690
00:40:54 --> 00:40:58
thing over this thing here.
 

691
00:40:58 --> 00:41:01
That's what's eventually
going to happen.

692
00:41:01 --> 00:41:03
But hold on to that idea.
 

693
00:41:03 --> 00:41:14
Let me carry out one
more example here.

694
00:41:14 --> 00:41:17
So I've figured out what
all the values are.

695
00:41:17 --> 00:41:21
But I think it's also worth it
to remember now that we also

696
00:41:21 --> 00:41:29
have to carry out
the integration.

697
00:41:29 --> 00:41:36
What I've just shown you is
that the integral of x ^2 dx

698
00:41:36 --> 00:41:42
over (x - 1)( x ^2 + 1) is
equal to, and I've split

699
00:41:42 --> 00:41:43
up into these pieces.
 

700
00:41:43 --> 00:41:45
So what are the pieces?
 

701
00:41:45 --> 00:42:01
The pieces are, 1/2, x -
1 + 1/2 x / x ^2 + 1.

702
00:42:01 --> 00:42:02
This is the A term.
 

703
00:42:02 --> 00:42:04
This is the B term.
 

704
00:42:04 --> 00:42:12
And then there's the C term.
 

705
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
So we'd better remember that we
know how to antidifferentiate

706
00:42:16 --> 00:42:18
these things.
 

707
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
In other words, I want
to finish the problem.

708
00:42:20 --> 00:42:22
The others were pretty easy, so
I didn't bother to finish my

709
00:42:22 --> 00:42:26
sentence, but here I want to be
careful and have you realize

710
00:42:26 --> 00:42:28
that there's something
a little more to do.

711
00:42:28 --> 00:42:31
First of all we have the, the
first one is no problem.

712
00:42:31 --> 00:42:35
That's this.
 

713
00:42:35 --> 00:42:39
The second one actually
is not too bad either.

714
00:42:39 --> 00:42:45
This is, by the advanced
guessing method, my favorite

715
00:42:45 --> 00:42:48
method, something like the
logarithm, because that's

716
00:42:48 --> 00:42:50
what's going to appear
in the denominator.

717
00:42:50 --> 00:42:51
And then, if you differentiate
this, you're going

718
00:42:51 --> 00:42:53
to get 2x over this.
 

719
00:42:53 --> 00:42:55
But here we have 1/2.
 

720
00:42:55 --> 00:42:59
So altogether it's 1/4 of this.
 

721
00:42:59 --> 00:43:02
So I fixed the
coefficient here.

722
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
And then the last one, you have
to think back to some level of

723
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10
memorization here and remember
that this is 1/2

724
00:43:10 --> 00:43:15
the arc tangent.
 

725
00:43:15 --> 00:43:20
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

726
00:43:20 --> 00:43:22
PROFESSOR: Why did I go to 1/4?
 

727
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
Because in disguise, for this
guy, I was thinking d / dx of

728
00:43:26 --> 00:43:35
ln (x ^2 + 1) = 2x / x^2 + 1.
 

729
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
Because it's the derivative
of this divided by itself.

730
00:43:39 --> 00:43:46
This is the derivative
of ln u is u ' / u.

731
00:43:46 --> 00:43:50
Ln u' = u' / u.
 

732
00:43:50 --> 00:43:54
That was what I applied.
 

733
00:43:54 --> 00:43:58
And what I had was 1/2, so I
need a total of 1/4 to cancel.

734
00:43:58 --> 00:44:06
So 2/4 is 1/2.
 

735
00:44:06 --> 00:44:09
Now I've got to get you out
of one more deep hole.

736
00:44:09 --> 00:44:12
And I'm going to save the
general pattern for next time.

737
00:44:12 --> 00:44:27
But I do want to
clarify one thing.

738
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
So let's handle this thing.
 

739
00:44:30 --> 00:44:34
What if the degree of P
is bigger than or equal

740
00:44:34 --> 00:44:39
to the degree of Q.
 

741
00:44:39 --> 00:44:42
That's the thing that
I claimed was easier.

742
00:44:42 --> 00:44:45
And I'm going to describe
to you how it's done.

743
00:44:45 --> 00:44:49
Now, in analogy, with
numbers you might call

744
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
this an improper fraction.
 

745
00:44:55 --> 00:44:59
That's the thing that should
echo in your mind when

746
00:44:59 --> 00:45:01
you're thinking about this.
 

747
00:45:01 --> 00:45:04
And I'm just going to
do it by example here.

748
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
Let's see., I cooked up an
example so that I don't

749
00:45:08 --> 00:45:11
make an arithmetistic
mistake along the way.

750
00:45:11 --> 00:45:16
So there are two or three
steps that I need to explain.

751
00:45:16 --> 00:45:18
So here's an example.
 

752
00:45:18 --> 00:45:21
The denominator's degree 2,
the numerator is degree 3.

753
00:45:21 --> 00:45:24
It well exceeds, so
there's a problem here.

754
00:45:24 --> 00:45:27
Our method is not
going to work.

755
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
And the first step that
I want to carry out

756
00:45:32 --> 00:45:36
is to reverse Step 1.
 

757
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
That is, I don't want the
factorization for what

758
00:45:38 --> 00:45:39
I'm going to do next.
 

759
00:45:39 --> 00:45:42
I want it multiplied out.
 

760
00:45:42 --> 00:45:48
That means I have to multiply
through, so I get x ^2 + x - 2.

761
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
I'm back to the
starting place here.

762
00:45:52 --> 00:45:57
And now, the next thing that
I'm going to do is, I'm

763
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
going to use long division.
 

764
00:46:01 --> 00:46:04
That's how you convert
an improper fraction

765
00:46:04 --> 00:46:07
to a proper fraction.
 

766
00:46:07 --> 00:46:12
This is something you were
supposed to learn in, I don't

767
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
know, Grade 4, I know.
 

768
00:46:16 --> 00:46:23
Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade
5, Grade 6, etc.

769
00:46:23 --> 00:46:27
So here's how it works in
the case of polynomials.

770
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31
It's kind of amusing.
 

771
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
So we're dividing this
polynomial into that one.

772
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
And so the quotient to
first order here is x.

773
00:46:41 --> 00:46:44
That is, that's going to
match the top terms.

774
00:46:44 --> 00:46:48
So I get x^3 + x ^2 - 2x.
 

775
00:46:48 --> 00:46:50
That's the product.
 

776
00:46:50 --> 00:46:51
And now I subtract.
 

777
00:46:51 --> 00:46:53
And it cancels.
 

778
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
So we get here - x ^2 + 2x.
 

779
00:46:58 --> 00:47:01
That's the difference.
 

780
00:47:01 --> 00:47:04
And now I need to divide
this next term in.

781
00:47:04 --> 00:47:08
And I need a - 1.
 

782
00:47:08 --> 00:47:14
So - 1 times this
is - x ^2 - x + 2.

783
00:47:14 --> 00:47:16
And I subtract.
 

784
00:47:16 --> 00:47:17
And the x^2's cancel.
 

785
00:47:17 --> 00:47:24
And here I get + 3x - 2.
 

786
00:47:24 --> 00:47:27
Now, this thing has a name.
 

787
00:47:27 --> 00:47:30
This is called the quotient.
 

788
00:47:30 --> 00:47:33
And this thing also has a name.
 

789
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
This is called the remainder.
 

790
00:47:39 --> 00:47:43
And now I'll show you how
it works by sticking it

791
00:47:43 --> 00:47:44
into the answer here.
 

792
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
The quotient is x - 1.
 

793
00:47:47 --> 00:47:51
And the remainder is,
let's get down there.

794
00:47:51 --> 00:47:58
3x - 2 / x ^2 + x - 2.
 

795
00:47:58 --> 00:48:03
So the punchline here
is that this thing is

796
00:48:03 --> 00:48:05
easy to integrate.
 

797
00:48:05 --> 00:48:08
This is easy.
 

798
00:48:08 --> 00:48:17
And this one, you can use, now
you can use cover-up, The

799
00:48:17 --> 00:48:18
method that we had before.
 

800
00:48:18 --> 00:48:21
Because the degree of the
numerator is now below the

801
00:48:21 --> 00:48:22
degree of the denominator.
 

802
00:48:22 --> 00:48:25
It's now first degree and
this is second degree.

803
00:48:25 --> 00:48:27
What you can't do
is use cover-up to

804
00:48:27 --> 00:48:29
start out with here.
 

805
00:48:29 --> 00:48:32
That will give you
the wrong answer.

806
00:48:32 --> 00:48:37
So that's the end for today,
and see you next time.

807
00:48:37 --> 00:48:37
