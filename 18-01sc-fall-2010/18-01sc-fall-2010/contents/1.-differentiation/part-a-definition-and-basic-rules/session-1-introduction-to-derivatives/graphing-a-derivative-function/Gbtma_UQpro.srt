00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,850
PROFESSOR: Welcome
to recitation.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,660
Today in this video
what we're going to do

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,250
is look at how we can
determine the graph

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,930
of a derivative of a
function from the graph

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,310
of the function itself.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,950
So I've given a function here.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,330
We're calling it just y equals
f of x-- or this is the curve,

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,260
y equals f of x.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,860
So we're thinking about
a function f of x.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm not giving you the
equation for the function.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,090
I'm just giving you the graph.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,780
And what I'd like
you to do, what

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,490
I'd like us to do
in this time, is

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,820
to figure out what
the curve y equals

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,570
f prime of x will look like.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,500
So that's our objective.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,940
So what we'll do first is
try and figure out the things

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,030
that we know about f prime of x.

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,600
So what I want to
remind you is that when

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,250
you think about a
function's derivative,

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,350
remember its
derivative's output is

22
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,870
measuring the slope of the
tangent line at each point.

23
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,810
So that's what we're
interested in finding,

24
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,310
is understanding the
slope of the tangent line

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,970
of this curve at each x-value.

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,890
So it's always
easiest when you're

27
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,160
thinking about a derivative
to find the places where

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,196
the slope of the
tangent line is 0.

29
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,570
Because those are
the only places

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,990
where you can hope to change
the sign on the derivative.

31
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,130
So what we'd like to do is
first identify, on this curve,

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,260
where the tangent line
has slope equal to 0.

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,390
And I think there are two places
we can find it fairly easily.

34
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,080
That would be at whatever this
x value is, that slope there

35
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,580
is 0.

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,640
It's going to be a
horizontal tangent line.

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,700
And then whatever
this x value is.

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,410
The slope there is also 0.

39
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,779
Horizontal tangent line.

40
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:40,320
But there's a third place where
the slope of the tangent line

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,510
is 0, and that's kind
of hidden right in here.

42
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,650
And actually, I've
drawn in-- maybe you

43
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,900
think there are a
few more-- but we're

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,430
going to assume that this
function is always continuing

45
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,050
down through this region.

46
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,590
So there are three places where
the tangent line is horizontal.

47
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,384
So I can even sort of draw
them lightly through here.

48
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,050
You have three
horizontal tangent lines.

49
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,230
So at those points, we know
that the derivative's value is

50
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,860
equal to 0, the
output is equal to 0.

51
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,630
And now what we can determine
is, between those regions,

52
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,590
where are the values of
the derivative positive and

53
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,560
negative?

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,426
So what I'm going
to do is below here,

55
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,050
I'm just going to
make a line and we're

56
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,210
going to sort of
keep track of what

57
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,000
the signs of the derivative are.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,770
So let me just draw.

59
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,691
This would be sort of
our sign on f prime.

60
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:35,190
OK.

61
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,210
So that's going to tell
us what our signs are.

62
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,100
So right below,
we'll keep track.

63
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,980
So here, this, I'll
just come straight down.

64
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,938
Here we know the sign of
f prime is equal to 0.

65
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,100
OK?

66
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,480
We know it's equal to 0 there.

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,002
We know it's also
equal to 0 here,

68
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,585
and we know it's
also equal to 0 here.

69
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:54,510
OK?

70
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,060
And now the question
is, what is the sign

71
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,890
of f prime in this region?

72
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,950
So to the left of
whatever that x value is.

73
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,990
What is the sign of f prime in
this region, in this region,

74
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,190
and then to the right?

75
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,650
So there are really-- we
can divide up the x-values

76
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,460
as left of whatever that
x-value is, in between these two

77
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,750
values, in between
these two values,

78
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,184
and to the right
of this x-value.

79
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,600
That's really,
really what we need

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,080
to do to determine what
the signs of f prime are.

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,350
So again, what we want
to do to understand

82
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,490
f prime is we look at the
slope of the tangent line

83
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,670
of the curve y equals f of x.

84
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,030
So let's pick a place in this
region left of where it's 0,

85
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,500
say right here, and let's
look at the tangent line.

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,060
The tangent line has
what kind of slope?

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,870
Well, it has a positive slope.

88
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,560
And in fact, if you look along
here, you see all of the slopes

89
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,100
are positive.

90
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,507
So f prime is
bigger than 0 here.

91
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,090
And now I'm just
going to record that.

92
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,798
I'm going to keep that
in mind as a plus.

93
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,010
The sign is positive there.

94
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,550
Now, if I look right of
where f prime equals 0,

95
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,190
if I look for
x-values to the right,

96
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,660
I see that as I
move to the right,

97
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,369
the tangent line
is curving down.

98
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,660
So let me do it with the chalk.

99
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,100
You see the tangent line looks,
has a slope negative slope.

100
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,020
If I draw one point in, it
looks something like that.

101
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,650
So the slope is negative there.

102
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,940
So here I can record that.

103
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,400
The sign of f prime
is a minus sign there.

104
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,540
Now, if I look between
these two x-values, which

105
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,810
I'm saying here it's 0 and
here it's 0 for the x values,

106
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,080
and I take a take a point, we
notice the sign is negative

107
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,900
there, also.

108
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,290
So in fact, the sign
of f prime changed

109
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,380
at this zero of f prime,
but it stays the same

110
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,970
around this zero of f prime.

111
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,400
So it's negative and then
it goes to negative again.

112
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,620
It's negative, then
0, then negative.

113
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,890
And then if I look to
the right of this x-value

114
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,790
and I take a point, I see that
the slope of the tangent line

115
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,689
is positive.

116
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,105
And so the sign
there is positive.

117
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,370
So we have the derivative is
positive, and then 0, and then

118
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,230
negative, and then 0, and then
negative, and then 0, and then

119
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,070
positive.

120
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,640
So there's a lot going on.

121
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,000
But I, if I want to plot,
now, y equals f prime of x, I

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
have some sort of launching
point by which to do that.

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,060
So what I can do is, I know
that the derivative 0--

124
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm going to draw the
derivative in blue,

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,380
here-- the derivative is 0, its
output is 0 at these places.

126
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,724
So I'm going to put
those points on.

127
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:29,140
And then if I were just trying
to get a rough idea of what

128
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,910
happens, the derivative is
positive left of this x value.

129
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,376
So it's certainly coming down.

130
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,413
It's coming down.

131
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:41,130
Oops, let me make
these a little darker.

132
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,190
It's coming down
because it's positive.

133
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,610
It's coming down to 0-- it
has to stay above the x-axis,

134
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,185
but it has to head towards 0.

135
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,677
Right?

136
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:51,260
What does that
actually correspond to?

137
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, look at what
the slopes are doing.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,070
The slopes of these
tangent lines,

139
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,250
as I move in the x-direction,
the slope-- let me just

140
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,630
keep my hand, watch what my hand
is doing-- the slope is always

141
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,960
positive, but it's becoming
less and less vertical, right?

142
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,710
It's headed towards horizontal.

143
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,470
So the slope that
was steeper over here

144
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,610
is becoming less steep.

145
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,120
The steepness is really the
magnitude of the derivative.

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,370
That's really measuring how far
it is, the output is, from 0.

147
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,610
So as the derivative
becomes less steep,

148
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,780
the derivative's values have
to be headed closer to 0.

149
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,649
Now, what happens when the
derivative is equal to 0 here?

150
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,940
Well, all of a sudden the
slopes are becoming negative.

151
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,735
So the outputs of the
derivative are negative.

152
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,150
It's going down.

153
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,140
But then once it hits here,
again, notice what happens.

154
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,780
The derivative is 0 again,
and notice how I get there.

155
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,494
The derivative's
negative, and then it

156
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:44,757
starts to-- the slopes of
these tangent lines start

157
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:45,465
to get shallower.

158
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,350
Right?

159
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,062
They were steep and
then somewhere they

160
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,020
start to get shallower.

161
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,270
So there's someplace sort of
in the x-values between here

162
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,100
and here where the
derivative is as

163
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,750
steep as it gets in this region,
and then gets less steep.

164
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,800
The steepest point
is that point where

165
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,020
you have the biggest magnitude
in that region for f prime.

166
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,650
So that's where it's going
to be furthest from 0.

167
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,020
So if I'm guessing,
it looks like right

168
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,720
around here the tangent
line is as steep as it ever

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,480
gets in that region,
between these two zeros,

170
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,980
and then it gets less steep.

171
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,110
So I'd say, right
around there we

172
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,094
should say, OK, that's
as low as it goes

173
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:22,552
and now it's going
to come back up.

174
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,390
OK?

175
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,850
So hopefully that makes sense.

176
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,640
We'll get to see it again, here.

177
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,430
Between these two zeros the
same kind of thing happens.

178
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,350
But notice-- this is, we have
to be careful-- we shouldn't

179
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,306
go through 0 here because
the derivative's output,

180
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,180
the sign is negative.

181
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,092
Right?

182
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,550
Notice, so the
tangent line, it was

183
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,380
negative, negative, negative,
0, oh, it's still negative.

184
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,260
So the outputs are
still negative,

185
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,870
and they're going to be negative
all the way to this zero.

186
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,530
And what we need to see again
is the same kind of thing

187
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,040
happens as happened
in this region

188
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,240
will happen in this region.

189
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,450
The point being that,
again, we're 0 here.

190
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,920
We're 0 here.

191
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,650
So somewhere in the
middle, we start at 0,

192
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,260
the tangent lines start to get
steeper, then at some point

193
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,090
they stop getting steeper,
they start getting shallower.

194
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,370
That place looks maybe
right around here.

195
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,770
That's the sort of
steepest tangent line,

196
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,180
then it gets less steep.

197
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,480
So that's the place where
the derivative's magnitude

198
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,621
is going to be the
biggest in this region.

199
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,120
And actually, I've
sort of drawn it,

200
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,620
they look like they're about
the same steepness at those two

201
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,370
places, so I should probably
put the outputs about the same

202
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:30,870
down here.

203
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,150
Their magnitudes
are about the same.

204
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,686
So this has to bounce
off, come up here.

205
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,560
I made that a little
sharper than I meant to.

206
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,720
OK?

207
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,710
So that's the place.

208
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,100
That's the output here--
or the tangent line, sorry.

209
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,690
The tangent line at this
x value is the steepest

210
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,210
that we get in this region,
so the output at that x-value

211
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,830
is the lowest we get.

212
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,370
And then, when
we're to the right

213
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,680
of this zero for
the derivative, we

214
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,610
start seeing the
tangent lines positive--

215
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,706
we pointed that out already--
and it gets more positive.

216
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,580
So it starts at 0, it
starts to get positive,

217
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,220
and then it gets more positive.

218
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,730
It's going to do something
like that, roughly.

219
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,580
So let me fill in the dotted
lines so we can see it clearly.

220
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,430
Well, this is not
exact, but this

221
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,130
is a fairly good drawing,
I think we can say,

222
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,260
of f prime of x.

223
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,740
y equals f prime of x.

224
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,670
And now I'm going to
ask you a question.

225
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,444
I'm going to write
it on the board,

226
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:38,860
and then I'm going to give you
a moment to think about it.

227
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,068
So let me write the question.

228
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:54,085
It's, find a function
y equals-- or sorry--

229
00:09:54,085 --> 00:10:06,200
find a function g of x so that
y equals g prime of x looks

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,566
like y equals f prime of x.

231
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,440
OK, let me be clear
about that, and then I'll

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,010
give you a moment
to think about it.

233
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,525
So I want you to
find a function g

234
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:20,910
of x so that its derivative's
graph, y equals g prime of x,

235
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,500
looks exactly like the graph
we've drawn in blue here,

236
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,230
y equals f prime of x.

237
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,470
Now, I don't want you to
find something in terms

238
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,460
of x squareds and x cubes.

239
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,620
I don't want you to find an
actual g of x equals something

240
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,390
in terms of x.

241
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,260
I want you to just try
and find a relationship

242
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,770
that it must have with f.

243
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,929
So I'm going to give me a
moment to think about it

244
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,220
and work out your answer,
and I'll be back to tell you.

245
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,280
OK.

246
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,170
Welcome back.

247
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,160
So what we're looking
for is a function

248
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,840
g of x so that its
derivative, when I graph it,

249
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,330
y equals g prime of x, I
get exactly the same curve

250
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,500
as the blue one.

251
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,970
The blue one.

252
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,780
And the point is
that if you thought

253
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,840
about it for a little
bit, what you really

254
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,670
need is a function that looks
exactly like this function,

255
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,510
y equals f of x, at all
the x-values in terms

256
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,230
of its slopes, but
those slopes can happen

257
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,190
shifted up or down anywhere.

258
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,650
So the point is that if I
take the function y equals

259
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,920
f of x and I add a constant
to it, which shifts

260
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,500
the whole graph up or
down, the tangent lines

261
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,570
are unaffected by that shift.

262
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,400
And so I get exactly
the same picture

263
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,070
when I take the
derivative of that graph.

264
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,070
When I look at that the tangent
line slopes of that graph.

265
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,010
So you could draw
another picture

266
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,790
and check it for yourself if
you didn't feel convinced,

267
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,390
shift this, shift this
curve up, and then look

268
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,400
at what the tangent
lines do on that curve.

269
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,590
But then you'll see its
derivative's outputs

270
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,350
are exactly the same.

271
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,819
So we'll stop there.
