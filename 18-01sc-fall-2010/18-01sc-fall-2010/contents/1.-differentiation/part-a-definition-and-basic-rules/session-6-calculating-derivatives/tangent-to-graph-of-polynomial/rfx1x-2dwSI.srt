JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,150
Welcome to recitation.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,840
In lecture you've learned
how to compute derivatives

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,900
of polynomials,
and you've learned

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,050
the relationship between
derivatives and tangents lines.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,340
So let's do a quick example that
puts those two ideas together.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,450
So here I have a
question on the board:

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,840
compute the tangent
line to the curve y

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,710
equals x cubed minus
x at the point (2, 6).

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,210
So why don't you
take a minute, work

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,559
on that yourself, pause
the video, we'll come back

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,600
and we'll do it together.

13
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:39,190
All right.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,170
Welcome back.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,510
So we have this function,
y equals x cubed minus x.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,270
Let's just draw a
quick sketch of it.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:57,760
So looks to me like it has
zeros at 0, 1, minus 1.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,860
And it sort of does something
like this in between.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,070
Very rough sketch there.

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,820
And way over-- well, OK.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,060
We'll call that
the point (2, 6).

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,560
Feel a little sketchy,
but all right.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,060
OK.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,220
So we want to know
what the tangent line

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,270
to the curve at that point is.

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,440
So in order to do that, we need
to know what its derivative is,

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,050
and then that'll
give us the slope.

28
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,799
And then with the
slope, we have the slope

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,930
and we have a point,
so we can slap

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,320
that into, say, your
point-slope formula for a line.

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,150
So, all right, so the derivative
of this function is y prime.

32
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,940
So, OK, so here we have
a sum of two things,

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,810
and they're both powers of x.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,060
And so we learned
our rules for a power

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,440
of x that the
derivative of x to the n

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,510
is n times x to the n minus 1.

37
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,640
And so we also learned
that the derivative

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,470
of a sum of two things is
the sum of the derivatives.

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,230
So in this case, so the
derivative of x cubed

40
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:08,076
minus x is 3 x squared minus 1.

41
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:08,576
OK.

42
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:13,480
So this is the slope of
the function in terms of x.

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,840
But in order to compute
the tangent line,

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,035
we need the slope at the
particular point in question.

45
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:20,535
Right?

46
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:22,120
This is really important.

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,870
So we aren't going to use 3 x
squared plus 1 as our slope.

48
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,780
Right?

49
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,750
We want the slope at
the point x equals 2.

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,250
Right?

51
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,030
OK.

52
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,100
So what we want for the
slope of the tangent line

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,640
is y prime of 2.

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,410
Right?

55
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,050
We want it at this point
when x is equal to 2.

56
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,155
So that's equal to, well, 3
times 2 squared is 12, minus 1

57
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:47,655
is 11.

58
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,180
So this is the slope, this is
the slope of the tangent line.

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,310
I just want to say this
one more time for emphasis.

60
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,690
This is a really
common mistake that we

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,500
see on lots of homework and
exams when teaching calculus.

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,460
You have to remember
that when you compute

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,390
the slope of the tangent line,
you compute the derivative

64
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,980
and then you need to
plug in the value of x

65
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,160
at the point in question.

66
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,620
Or the value of x and y.

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,970
You know, you need to plug
in the values of the point

68
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,380
that you have.

69
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,410
So here, the derivative
is 3 x squared minus 1,

70
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,760
so the slope at the
point (2, 6) is 11.

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,240
It's just a number.

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,940
The slope at that point
is that particular number.

73
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,910
OK, so now, to compute
the tangent line,

74
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,950
we have a point, (2, 6),
and we have a slope, 11.

75
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,400
So we can plug into
point-slope form.

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:11,572
So the equation of the-- on
the-- tangent line is y minus 6

77
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:16,107
is equal to 11 times x minus 2.

78
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:16,870
Right?

79
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,340
So it's y minus y_0 is equal
to the slope times x minus x_0.

80
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,530
If you like, some
people prefer to write

81
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,209
their equations of their
lines in slope-intercept form.

82
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,000
So if you wanted to do
that, you could just

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,500
multiply through by 11 and then
bring the constants together.

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,680
So we could say, or
y equals 11x-- well,

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,050
we get minus 22
plus 6 is minus 16.

86
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,540
So either of those is
a perfectly good answer

87
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,720
to the question.

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,410
So that's that.
