00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,600
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,910
In this segment I'm going
to actually show-- well,

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,700
you're actually going to show--
the derivative of tangent

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,300
x using the quotient rule.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,170
So what I'd like you to
do, I wanted to remind you

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,810
of what the quotient rule is.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,750
So u and v are functions of x.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,040
We want to take the
derivative of u divided

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,020
by v. I've written
the formula that you

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,420
were given in class for this.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,850
And I'm asking for you
to take d/dx of tangent x

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,240
using the quotient rule.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,810
And the hint I will give you
is the reason we can obviously

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,640
use the quotient rule
is because tangent x is

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
equal to a quotient
of two functions of x.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,050
It's sine x divided
by cosine of x.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,240
So I'm going to give you
a minute to work this out

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,390
for yourself, and then when we
come back I will do it for you.

19
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:55,500
OK.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,220
So we want to find the
derivative of tangent x.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,200
So let me-- let me work
on this side of the board.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,370
So I'm actually going to
take d/dx of sine x divided

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,481
by cosine of x.

24
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:11,980
OK.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,160
So in this case, sine x is u.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,419
Cosine x is v. So using my
quotient rule I know that first

27
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,960
I have to take the
derivative of sine

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,140
x-- that's cosine x--
and then I multiply it

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,000
by the denominator, the
v, which is cosine x.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,320
So my first term in the
numerator is cosine squared x.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,210
Again, one cosine x comes
from the derivative of sine x,

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,630
one cosine x is the v. It's the
cosine x in the denominator.

33
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,250
Then I have to
subtract v prime u.

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,270
The derivative of cosine
x is negative sine x.

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,710
I'll actually just
write that one down.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,520
And then I bring the
u along for the ride.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,580
So I multiply by sine x here.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,460
And then I take v squared in the
denominator from the formula.

39
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,470
v, again, is cosine
x, so I take cosine

40
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,125
squared x in the denominator.

41
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,000
Now this at this point
is a little bit messy,

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,620
but the nice thing
is that we can

43
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,820
use some trigonometric
identities to simplify this.

44
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,820
So let me first write out what
it is a little more clearly.

45
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,770
Minus a negative
gives you a positive.

46
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,540
And then here I get
sine x times sine

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,700
x, so I get the sine squared x.

48
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,320
And then I keep divided
by cosine squared x.

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,080
Now at this point
some of you might

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,990
have divided by
cosine squared x here

51
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,870
and gotten 1, and divided
by cosine squared x here

52
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,890
and gotten tangent squared x.

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,600
And then from there
you could simplify

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,430
to another
trigonometric function.

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,250
I'm going to go straight a
different way to show you

56
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,140
what that actually also equals.

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,830
So there, at this
point I want to stress

58
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,640
there are sort of two ways
you can get to the same place.

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,910
But I'm going to use the
fact that the numerator is

60
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,950
a very nice trigonometric
identity that we know.

61
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,890
We know cosine squared x plus
sine squared x always equals 1.

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,470
So this is quite lovely, the
numerator simplifies to 1,

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,460
the denominator stays
cosine squared x.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,980
What is this function?

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,070
1 over cosine x is
actually secant x.

66
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,260
So if you need, at this point,
to rewrite the whole thing

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,180
like this, right?

68
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,430
1 squared is 1 and in
the denominator we still

69
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,170
get cosine squared x-- this
tells you that 1 over cosine

70
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,100
squared x is actually just
equal to secant squared x.

71
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,660
So again, what I
want to point out

72
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,500
is we've now taken the
derivative of tangent x

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,400
and we got that that's
secant squared x.

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,110
Now using this
quotient rule, you

75
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,720
can do the same kind of
thing with cotangent x,

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,760
with cosecant x, with secant x.

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,230
You can find all
these derivatives

78
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,750
of these trigonometric functions
using the quotient rule.

79
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,250
So if you want to know what
the derivative of secant x is,

80
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,640
you should take d(dx of 1
divided by cosine x and use

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,710
the quotient rule.

82
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,780
Or, in fact, the chain rule
would work well there also,

83
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,780
to find that derivative.

84
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,200
So we are building up
the number of derivatives

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,540
we can find using
these different rules.

86
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,761
So we'll stop there.
