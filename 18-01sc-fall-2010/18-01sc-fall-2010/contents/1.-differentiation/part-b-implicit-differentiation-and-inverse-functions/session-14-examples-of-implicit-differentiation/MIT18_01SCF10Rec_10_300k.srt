00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,690
PROFESSOR: Hi.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,480
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,760
Last time in lecture you
started learning about

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,330
implicit differentiation.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,300
And you saw some examples of how
implicit differentiation

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,130
can be used to compute
derivatives of functions

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,230
defined implicitly.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,390
So let's do another
example today.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,590
So here I have a curve that's
defined by the implicit

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,220
equation y cubed plus
x cubed equals 3xy.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,900
And I'd like to know what the
slope of the tangent line to

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,800
that curve is at the
point 4/3, 2/3.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,900
So before we start doing
anything, let me just make a

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,450
couple of observations.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,850
If you don't believe me, that
the point 4/3, 2/3 is on this

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,080
curve, you can always check by
plugging the values in and

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,880
confirm that really, yes, 4/3
cubed plus 2/3 cubed is equal

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,470
to 3 times 2/3 times 4/3.

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,080
So it's how I found this point
is maybe a little magical.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,250
Because as you can see, this
equation is really a tough one

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,920
to solve for y.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,280
What you sort of, a natural
thing to want to do when asked

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,870
this question is to solve for y
and get an equation for y in

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,930
terms of x and then take the
derivative using the various

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,244
differentiation rules
that you've learned.

27
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:24,320
But here, this is, I'll
let you in a secret.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,990
There is a way to do this.

29
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,060
But it's really hard.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,170
It's really ugly and
it's beyond the

31
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,420
scope of this course.

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,800

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,490
So really we're much better
off treating this as an

34
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,830
implicit differentiation problem
than as an explicit

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,400
differentiation problem.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,650
So having said that, why don't
you take a minute or two.

37
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,000
Try and have a go at
this yourself.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
And then we'll come back and
work through it together.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,320
All right, so welcome back.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,820
We were in the middle--
we were just

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,890
about to start, actually--

42
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,370
solving this problem, computing
the slope of the

43
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,740
tangent line to the curve y
cubed plus x cubed equals 3xy

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,680
at this point, 4/3, 2/3.

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,970
So the slope of the tangent line
is the value y prime of x

46
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,290
at that point.

47
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,940
So we need to answer
this question.

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,460
What we need to do is we need
to find the derivative of y.

49
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,660
But as I said earlier, this is
tough to do explicitly, to

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,190
find y in terms of x, so we're
going to use implicit

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,340
differentiation.

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,390
So, so we start with this
equation, y cubed plus x cubed

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,530
equals 3xy and we can take a
derivative with respect to x.

54
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,200
So some parts, all right, so
let's start with it in the

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,990
order its given.

56
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,770
So you have y cubed.

57
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,525
If you take a derivative of y
cubed with respect to x, what

58
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:47,550
you need to use the chain rule
because y is implicitly a

59
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,320
function of x and so y cubed
is the chain rule.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,330
It's the cubed function applied
to the y function.

61
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,410
And this is true of implicit
differentiation in general.

62
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,190
That the reason that we can do
this, the really fundamental

63
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,625
reason this works is that we
have the chain rule and that

64
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,310
it lets us evaluate derivatives
of compositions.

65
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,210
So in our case we have, so we
take a derivative of the whole

66
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,298
thing, of this whole--

67
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:12,562
I'm going to write, this is a
little sloppy notation, but I

68
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,812
hope you know what I mean.

69
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:20,080

70
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,290
We have this identity and
so we're going to take a

71
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,480
derivative of the whole thing.

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,380
And so the first part on
the left, we get the

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,280
derivative of y cubed.

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,350
So by the chain rule, so we
first take the derivative of

75
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,690
the cube function at y and
then multiply by the

76
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,640
derivative of y.

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,230
So this is the derivative
of y cubed.

78
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,370
It just gives us 3y squared.

79
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,740
So that's what happens
when you just deal

80
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,560
with the cubed part.

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,150
But then we need to
multiply by--

82
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,570
in the chain rule-- by the
derivative if the inside.

83
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,405
Which in this context
is dy by dx.

84
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,490
OK.

85
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,960
Plus the derivative
of x cubed.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,470
That's more straightforward.

87
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,520
Nothing really complicated
going on here.

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,310
We've seen this for a
little while now.

89
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,220
It's just 3x squared equal.

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,200
OK.

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,520
So on the right now, we don't
actually have a chain rule, we

92
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,470
have a product rule
situation here.

93
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,220
We have 3 times x times y.

94
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,410
So 3 is just a constant.

95
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,230
And so we could just pull
it out in front.

96
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,600
So we take the derivative
of xy.

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,420
So we take the derivative of
the first times the second

98
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,390
plus the derivative of the
second times the first. So the

99
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,490
derivative of the first is
just-- ah sorry, x is the

100
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,840
first, so its derivative is 1.

101
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,720
So we got 3 times
the second is y.

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:38,895
Plus--

103
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:44,480
OK, so we take the first times
the derivative of the second,

104
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,230
which is dy by dx.

105
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,550
So because this is an identity
it holds for all

106
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,690
values of x and y.

107
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,060
This equality follows
just by taking the

108
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,280
derivative of both sides.

109
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,550
Good.

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,635
So now the thing we want is that
we want the slope of the

111
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,280
tangent line at a particular
point.

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,190
So we want to isolate dy dx.

113
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,040
That's the thing we're
trying to find.

114
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,770
So here, if you're only
interested in dy dx, this is

115
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,180
actually a linear equation
in some sense.

116
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,192
Right?

117
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:23,430
We have dy dx, a constant,
something-- or it's not a

118
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,220
constant-- something times dy
dx plus something equals

119
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,860
something plus something
times dy dx.

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,270
There are no squares of dy
dx is what I really mean.

121
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,456
So OK.

122
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,430
So that that's nice.

123
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,090
It makes it relatively easier
to solve so we can just

124
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,780
combine all the terms
with dy dx in them.

125
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,400
Let's say we'll combine maybe,
put them over here and put

126
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,700
everything else over there.

127
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:53,970
So over here we get, so
dy dx, so we have a 3y

128
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,600
squared minus a 3x.

129
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,580
And on the other side we have
a 3y minus a 3x squared.

130
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,590
And so this is times,
multiplication there.

131
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,670
And so we want dy by
dx just by itself.

132
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,370
So we can just divide through
by 3y squared minus 3x.

133
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,900
So then we have dy
dx is equal to--

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,870
well, all right, so there
are a lot of 3s here.

135
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,962
There's a constant multiple of
3 on this side, a constant

136
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:27,930
multiple of 3 on this side.

137
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,000
Those are going to cancel.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,210
So this is y minus x squared
over y squared minus x.

139
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,840
OK, so at any point, xy on this
curve, the slope of the

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,190
tangent line is given by
this expression here.

141
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,680
And we're interested
in a particular

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,430
point in this problem.

143
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,220
We're interested in the
point 4/3 comma 2/3.

144
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:04,725
So at-- let me take that back up
here-- so at the point 4/3

145
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:12,000
comma 2/3 we have dy by dx.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,440
So OK, we just we just plug that
value of y and that value

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,550
of x into this formula
that we've got.

148
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:27,510
So that's 2/3 minus 4/3
squared is 16/9 over--

149
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:36,670
well, let's see, 2/3 squared
is 4/9 minus 4/3.

150
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,600
All right, so we have a little
bit of irrational number

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,030
arithmetic here.

152
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,570
Maybe I'll multiply top and
bottom through by 9 to get 6

153
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,860
minus 16 over 4 minus 12.

154
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,912
So this is negative 10 over
negative 8, which is 5 over 4.

155
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,570

156
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,450
And if we go back to the
picture that I drew, it

157
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,640
actually looks pretty reasonable
over here, right?

158
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,290
This slope of this tangent line
is actually a little bit

159
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,150
bigger than 1.

160
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,220
Great.

161
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,790
So that's that.

162
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,629
