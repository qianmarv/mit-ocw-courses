9
00:00:22,6 --> 00:00:27,38
Okay so I'd like to begin the
second lecture by reminding

10
00:00:27,38 --> 00:00:30,77
you what we did last time.

11
00:00:30,77 --> 00:00:54,55
So last time, we defined the
derivative as the slope

12
00:00:54,55 --> 00:01:04,26
of a tangent line.

13
00:01:04,26 --> 00:01:08,4
So that was our geometric point
of view and we also did a

14
00:01:08,4 --> 00:01:10,47
couple of computations.

15
00:01:10,47 --> 00:01:14,5
We worked out that the
derivative of 1 /

16
00:01:14,5 --> 00:01:20,1
x was -1 / x^2.

17
00:01:20,1 --> 00:01:27,1
And we also computed the
derivative of x ^ nth power for

18
00:01:27,1 --> 00:01:32,31
n = 1, 2, etc., and that turned
out to be x, I'm

19
00:01:32,31 --> 00:01:32,93
sorry, nx^(n-1).

20
00:01:32,93 --> 00:01:36,97

21
00:01:36,97 --> 00:01:46,53
So that's what we did last
time, and today I want to

22
00:01:46,53 --> 00:01:53,43
finish up with other points of
view on what a derivative is.

23
00:01:53,43 --> 00:01:57,35
So this is extremely important,
it's almost the most important

24
00:01:57,35 --> 00:01:58,75
thing I'll be saying
in the class.

25
00:01:58,75 --> 00:02:01,31
But you'll have to think about
it again when you start over

26
00:02:01,31 --> 00:02:04,6
and start using calculus
in the real world.

27
00:02:04,6 --> 00:02:14,71
So again we're talking about
what is a derivative and this

28
00:02:14,71 --> 00:02:19,66
is just a continuation
of last time.

29
00:02:19,66 --> 00:02:23,26
So, as I said last time, we
talked about geometric

30
00:02:23,26 --> 00:02:28,81
interpretations, and today what
we're gonna talk about is rate

31
00:02:28,81 --> 00:02:40
of change as an interpretation
of the derivative.

32
00:02:40 --> 00:02:47,13
So remember we drew graphs of
functions, y = f(x) and we

33
00:02:47,13 --> 00:02:51,855
kept track of the change in x
and here the change

34
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:56,14
in y, let's say.

35
00:02:56,14 --> 00:03:02,18
And then from this new point of
view a rate of change, keeping

36
00:03:02,18 --> 00:03:05,65
track of the rate of change of
x and the rate of change of y,

37
00:03:05,65 --> 00:03:08,71
it's the relative rate of
change we're interested in, and

38
00:03:08,71 --> 00:03:14,7
that's delta y / delta x and
that has another

39
00:03:14,7 --> 00:03:16,01
interpretation.

40
00:03:16,01 --> 00:03:21,65
This is the average change.

41
00:03:21,65 --> 00:03:26,88
Usually we would think of that,
if x were measuring time and so

42
00:03:26,88 --> 00:03:32,63
the average and that's when
this becomes a rate, and

43
00:03:32,63 --> 00:03:35,83
the average is over the
time interval delta x.

44
00:03:35,83 --> 00:03:45,47
And then the limiting value is
denoted dy/dx and so this one

45
00:03:45,47 --> 00:03:48,76
is the average rate of change
and this one is the

46
00:03:48,76 --> 00:03:59,86
instantaneous rate.

47
00:03:59,86 --> 00:04:02,67
Okay, so that's the point of
view that I'd like to discuss

48
00:04:02,67 --> 00:04:06,2
now and give you just
a couple of examples.

49
00:04:06,2 --> 00:04:12,98
So, let's see.

50
00:04:12,98 --> 00:04:19,62
Well, first of all, maybe some
examples from physics here.

51
00:04:19,62 --> 00:04:31,34
So q is usually the name for
a charge, and then dq/dt is

52
00:04:31,34 --> 00:04:33,66
what's known as current.

53
00:04:33,66 --> 00:04:38,6
So that's one physical example.

54
00:04:38,6 --> 00:04:45,2
A second example, which is
probably the most tangible one,

55
00:04:45,2 --> 00:04:51,74
is we could denote know the
letter s by distance and

56
00:04:51,74 --> 00:04:58,52
then the rate of change is
that what we call speed.

57
00:04:58,52 --> 00:05:03,85
So those are the two typical
examples and I just want to

58
00:05:03,85 --> 00:05:08,35
illustrate the second example
in a little bit more detail

59
00:05:08,35 --> 00:05:10,56
because I think it's important
to have some visceral

60
00:05:10,56 --> 00:05:16,32
sense of this notion of
instantaneous speed.

61
00:05:16,32 --> 00:05:22,57
And I get to use the example of
this very building to do that.

62
00:05:22,57 --> 00:05:28,72
Probably you know, or maybe
you don't, that on Halloween

63
00:05:28,72 --> 00:05:32,65
there's an event that takes
place in this building or

64
00:05:32,65 --> 00:05:34,84
really from the top of this
building which is called

65
00:05:34,84 --> 00:05:37
the pumpkin drop.

66
00:05:37 --> 00:05:44,45
So let's illustrates this
idea of rate of change

67
00:05:44,45 --> 00:05:49,04
with the pumpkin drop.

68
00:05:49,04 --> 00:05:54,5
So what happens is this
building, well let's see here's

69
00:05:54,5 --> 00:06:03,15
the building, and here's the
dot, that's the beautiful grass

70
00:06:03,15 --> 00:06:07,47
out on this side of the
building, and then there's some

71
00:06:07,47 --> 00:06:12,6
people up here and very small
objects, well they're not that

72
00:06:12,6 --> 00:06:16,59
small when you're close to
them, that get dumped

73
00:06:16,59 --> 00:06:19
over the side there.

74
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21,51
And they fall down.

75
00:06:21,51 --> 00:06:24,17
You know everything at MIT
or a lot of things at MIT

76
00:06:24,17 --> 00:06:28,43
are physics experiments.

77
00:06:28,43 --> 00:06:29,44
That's the pumpkin drop.

78
00:06:29,44 --> 00:06:33,7
So roughly speaking, the
building is about 300 feet

79
00:06:33,7 --> 00:06:39,57
high, we're down here on
the first usable floor.

80
00:06:39,57 --> 00:06:44,61
And so we're going to use
instead of 300 feet, just for

81
00:06:44,61 --> 00:06:50,22
convenience purposes we'll use
80 meters because that makes

82
00:06:50,22 --> 00:06:55,41
the numbers come out simply.

83
00:06:55,41 --> 00:07:05,52
So we have the height which
starts out at 80 meters at time

84
00:07:05,52 --> 00:07:10,3
0 and then the acceleration due
to gravity gives you this

85
00:07:10,3 --> 00:07:13,33
formula for h, this
is the height.

86
00:07:13,33 --> 00:07:21,76
So at time t = 0, we're up
at the top, h is 80 meters,

87
00:07:21,76 --> 00:07:24,58
the units here are meters.

88
00:07:24,58 --> 00:07:32,2
And at time t = 4 you
notice, (5 * 4^2) is 80.

89
00:07:32,2 --> 00:07:34,24
I picked these numbers
conveniently so that we're

90
00:07:34,24 --> 00:07:38,32
down at the bottom.

91
00:07:38,32 --> 00:07:45,77
Okay, so this notion of average
change here, so the average

92
00:07:45,77 --> 00:07:53,08
change, or the average speed
here, maybe we'll call it the

93
00:07:53,08 --> 00:08:02,29
average speed since that's,
over this time that it takes

94
00:08:02,29 --> 00:08:06,48
for the pumpkin to drop is
going to be the change

95
00:08:06,48 --> 00:08:10,17
in h / the change in t.

96
00:08:10,17 --> 00:08:18,35
Which starts out at, what
does it start out as?

97
00:08:18,35 --> 00:08:21,87
It starts out as 80, right?

98
00:08:21,87 --> 00:08:23,93
And it ends at 0.

99
00:08:23,93 --> 00:08:26,52
So actually we have
to do it backwards.

100
00:08:26,52 --> 00:08:33,29
We have to take 0 - 80 because
the first value is the final

101
00:08:33,29 --> 00:08:37,39
position and the second value
is the initial position.

102
00:08:37,39 --> 00:08:41,47
And that's divided by 4
- 0; times 4 seconds

103
00:08:41,47 --> 00:08:43,68
minus times 0 seconds.

104
00:08:43,68 --> 00:08:49,2
And so that of course is
-20 meters per second.

105
00:08:49,2 --> 00:08:56,86
So the average speed of this
guy is 20 meters a second.

106
00:08:56,86 --> 00:09:00,97
Now, so why did I
pick this example?

107
00:09:00,97 --> 00:09:04,48
Because, of course, the
average, although interesting,

108
00:09:04,48 --> 00:09:06,86
is not really what anybody
cares about who actually

109
00:09:06,86 --> 00:09:08,67
goes to the event.

110
00:09:08,67 --> 00:09:12,37
All we really care about is the
instantaneous speed when it

111
00:09:12,37 --> 00:09:22,95
hits the pavement and so that's
can be calculated

112
00:09:22,95 --> 00:09:23,61
at the bottom.

113
00:09:23,61 --> 00:09:25,33
So what's the
instantaneous speed?

114
00:09:25,33 --> 00:09:30,36
That's the derivative, or maybe
to be consistent with the

115
00:09:30,36 --> 00:09:35,95
notation I've been using
so far, that's d/dt of h.

116
00:09:35,95 --> 00:09:37,58
All right?

117
00:09:37,58 --> 00:09:39,09
So that's d/dt of h.

118
00:09:39,09 --> 00:09:42,02
Now remember we have
formulas for these things.

119
00:09:42,02 --> 00:09:43,85
We can differentiate
this function now.

120
00:09:43,85 --> 00:09:47,93
We did that yesterday.

121
00:09:47,93 --> 00:09:51,35
So we're gonna take the rate of
change and if you take a look

122
00:09:51,35 --> 00:09:57,25
at it, it's just the rate of
change of 80 is 0, minus

123
00:09:57,25 --> 00:10:02,86
the rate change for this
-5t^2, that's minus 10t.

124
00:10:02,86 --> 00:10:09
So that's using the fact that
d/dt of 80 is equal to 0 and

125
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12,35
d/dt of t^2 is equal to 2t.

126
00:10:12,35 --> 00:10:14,42
The special case...

127
00:10:14,42 --> 00:10:17,69
Well I'm cheating here,
but there's a special

128
00:10:17,69 --> 00:10:18,5
case that's obvious.

129
00:10:18,5 --> 00:10:19,85
I didn't throw it in over here.

130
00:10:19,85 --> 00:10:23,75
The case n = 2 is that
second case there.

131
00:10:23,75 --> 00:10:30,38
But the case n = 0 also works.

132
00:10:30,38 --> 00:10:31,62
Because that's constants.

133
00:10:31,62 --> 00:10:32,95
The derivative of
a constant is 0.

134
00:10:32,95 --> 00:10:36,96
And then the factor n there's
0 and that's consistent.

135
00:10:36,96 --> 00:10:39,14
And actually if you look at the
formula above it you'll see

136
00:10:39,14 --> 00:10:44,09
that it's the case of n = -1.

137
00:10:44,09 --> 00:10:49,82
So we'll get a larger pattern
soon enough with the powers.

138
00:10:49,82 --> 00:10:50,45
Okay anyway.

139
00:10:50,45 --> 00:10:54,09
Back over here we have
our rate of change and

140
00:10:54,09 --> 00:10:55,38
this is what it is.

141
00:10:55,38 --> 00:11:00,01
And at the bottom, at that
point of impact, we have t

142
00:11:00,01 --> 00:11:07,75
= 4 and so h' which is the
derivative is equal to

143
00:11:07,75 --> 00:11:12,86
-40 meters per second.

144
00:11:12,86 --> 00:11:19,07
So twice as fast as the average
speed here, and if you need

145
00:11:19,07 --> 00:11:22,9
to convert that, that's
about 90 miles an hour.

146
00:11:22,9 --> 00:11:29,45
Which is why the police are
there at midnight on Halloween

147
00:11:29,45 --> 00:11:33,41
to make sure you're all safe
and also why when you come you

148
00:11:33,41 --> 00:11:37,33
have to be prepared to
clean up afterwards.

149
00:11:37,33 --> 00:11:40,26
So anyway that's what happens,
it's 90 miles an hour.

150
00:11:40,26 --> 00:11:42,63
It's actually the buildings a
little taller, there's air

151
00:11:42,63 --> 00:11:46,88
resistance and I'm sure you
can do a much more thorough

152
00:11:46,88 --> 00:11:50,35
study of this example.

153
00:11:50,35 --> 00:11:54,3
All right so now I want to give
you a couple of more examples

154
00:11:54,3 --> 00:11:58,81
because time and these kinds of
parameters and variables are

155
00:11:58,81 --> 00:12:02,57
not the only ones that are
important for calculus.

156
00:12:02,57 --> 00:12:06,3
If it were only this kind of
physics that was involved, then

157
00:12:06,3 --> 00:12:08,54
this would be a much more
specialized subject than it.

158
00:12:08,54 --> 00:12:13,34
Is And so I want to give you a
couple of examples that don't

159
00:12:13,34 --> 00:12:16,57
involved time as a variable.

160
00:12:16,57 --> 00:12:21,72
So the third example
I'll give here is.

161
00:12:21,72 --> 00:12:31,27
The letter t often denotes
temperature, and then dt/dx

162
00:12:31,27 --> 00:12:38,83
would be what is known as
the temperature gradient.

163
00:12:38,83 --> 00:12:43,94
Which we really care about a
lot when we're predicting the

164
00:12:43,94 --> 00:12:46,29
weather because it's that
temperature difference

165
00:12:46,29 --> 00:12:52,14
that causes air flows and
causes things to change.

166
00:12:52,14 --> 00:12:59,16
And then there's another theme
which is throughout the

167
00:12:59,16 --> 00:13:02,76
sciences and engineering which
I'm going to talk about under

168
00:13:02,76 --> 00:13:15,6
the heading of sensitivity
of measurements.

169
00:13:15,6 --> 00:13:18,47
So let me explain this.

170
00:13:18,47 --> 00:13:22,26
I don't want to belabor it
because I just am doing this in

171
00:13:22,26 --> 00:13:26,38
order to introduce you to the
ideas on your problem set which

172
00:13:26,38 --> 00:13:29,35
are the first case of this.

173
00:13:29,35 --> 00:13:35,26
So on problem set one you have
an example which is based on a

174
00:13:35,26 --> 00:13:39,55
simplified model of GPS, sort
of the Flat Earth Model.

175
00:13:39,55 --> 00:13:42,76
And in that situation, well, if
the Earth is flat it's just

176
00:13:42,76 --> 00:13:45,49
a horizontal line like this.

177
00:13:45,49 --> 00:13:54,02
And then you have a satellite,
which is over here, preferably

178
00:13:54,02 --> 00:14:03,06
above the earth, and the
satellite or the system knows

179
00:14:03,06 --> 00:14:05,2
exactly where the point
directly below the

180
00:14:05,2 --> 00:14:06,48
satellite is.

181
00:14:06,48 --> 00:14:12,17
So this point is
treated as known.

182
00:14:12,17 --> 00:14:24,43
And I'm sitting here with
my little GPS device and I

183
00:14:24,43 --> 00:14:26,44
want to know where I am.

184
00:14:26,44 --> 00:14:30,06
And the way I locate where I am
is I communicate with this

185
00:14:30,06 --> 00:14:36,74
satellite by radio signals and
I can measure this distance

186
00:14:36,74 --> 00:14:38,75
here which is called h.

187
00:14:38,75 --> 00:14:42,84
And then system will
computer this horizontal

188
00:14:42,84 --> 00:14:47,07
distance which is L.

189
00:14:47,07 --> 00:14:58,91
So in other words what is
measured, so h measured by

190
00:14:58,91 --> 00:15:04,91
radios, radio waves and a
clock, or various clocks.

191
00:15:04,91 --> 00:15:13,56
And then L is deduced from h.

192
00:15:13,56 --> 00:15:17,63
And what's critical in all of
these systems is that you

193
00:15:17,63 --> 00:15:20,32
don't know h exactly.

194
00:15:20,32 --> 00:15:26,33
There's an error in h which
will denote delta h.

195
00:15:26,33 --> 00:15:31,04
There's some degree
of uncertainty.

196
00:15:31,04 --> 00:15:35,55
The main uncertainty in GPS
is from the ionosphere.

197
00:15:35,55 --> 00:15:38,45
But there are lots of
corrections that are

198
00:15:38,45 --> 00:15:41,34
made of all kinds.

199
00:15:41,34 --> 00:15:43,65
And also if you're inside
a building it's a

200
00:15:43,65 --> 00:15:44,79
problem to measure it.

201
00:15:44,79 --> 00:15:48,22
But it's an extremely
important issue, as I'll

202
00:15:48,22 --> 00:15:49,73
explain in a second.

203
00:15:49,73 --> 00:16:01,44
So the idea is we then get at
delta L is estimated by

204
00:16:01,44 --> 00:16:06
considering this ratio delta
L/delta h which is going to be

205
00:16:06 --> 00:16:11,01
approximately the same as
the derivative of L

206
00:16:11,01 --> 00:16:13,91
with respect to h.

207
00:16:13,91 --> 00:16:16,32
So this is the thing
that's easy because of

208
00:16:16,32 --> 00:16:18,94
course it's calculus.

209
00:16:18,94 --> 00:16:22,85
Calculus is the easy part and
that allows us to deduce

210
00:16:22,85 --> 00:16:28,6
something about the real world
that's close by over here.

211
00:16:28,6 --> 00:16:31,98
So the reason why you should
care about this quite a bit

212
00:16:31,98 --> 00:16:34,87
is that it's used all the
time to land airplanes.

213
00:16:34,87 --> 00:16:38,22
So you really do care that they
actually know to within a few

214
00:16:38,22 --> 00:16:42,77
feet or even closer where
your plane is and how high

215
00:16:42,77 --> 00:16:48,57
up it is and so forth.

216
00:16:48,57 --> 00:16:48,65
All right.

217
00:16:48,65 --> 00:16:51,15
So that's it for the general
introduction of what

218
00:16:51,15 --> 00:16:52,01
a derivative is.

219
00:16:52,01 --> 00:16:54,26
I'm sure you'll be getting used
to this in a lot of different

220
00:16:54,26 --> 00:16:56,56
contexts throughout the course.

221
00:16:56,56 --> 00:17:04,51
And now we have to get back
down to some rigorous details.

222
00:17:04,51 --> 00:17:09,72
Ok, everybody happy with
what we've got so far?

223
00:17:09,72 --> 00:17:10,04
Yeah?

224
00:17:10,04 --> 00:17:13,4
Student: How did you get
the equation for height?

225
00:17:13,4 --> 00:17:14,98
Professor: Ah good
question question.

226
00:17:14,98 --> 00:17:18,56
The question was how did I get
this equation for height?

227
00:17:18,56 --> 00:17:25,38
I just made it up because it's
the formula from physics that

228
00:17:25,38 --> 00:17:30,06
you will learn when you take
8.01 and, in fact, it has to do

229
00:17:30,06 --> 00:17:35,87
with the fact that this is the
speed if you differentiate

230
00:17:35,87 --> 00:17:39,86
another time you get
acceleration and acceleration

231
00:17:39,86 --> 00:17:42,33
due to gravity is 10
meters per second.

232
00:17:42,33 --> 00:17:44,45
Which happens to be the
second derivative of this.

233
00:17:44,45 --> 00:17:46,96
But anyway I just pulled
it out of a hat from

234
00:17:46,96 --> 00:17:48,35
your physics class.

235
00:17:48,35 --> 00:17:55,51
So you can just say see 8.01 .

236
00:17:55,51 --> 00:18:02,84
All right, other questions?

237
00:18:02,84 --> 00:18:04,97
All right, so let's go on now.

238
00:18:04,97 --> 00:18:09,34
Now I have to be a little bit
more systematic about limits.

239
00:18:09,34 --> 00:18:20,13
So let's do that now.

240
00:18:20,13 --> 00:18:30,37
So now what I'd like to talk
about is limits and continuity.

241
00:18:30,37 --> 00:18:34,96
And this is a warm up for
deriving all the rest of the

242
00:18:34,96 --> 00:18:38,19
formulas, all the rest of
the formulas that I'm going

243
00:18:38,19 --> 00:18:41,6
to need to differentiate
every function you know.

244
00:18:41,6 --> 00:18:44,99
Remember, that's our goal and
we only have about a week left

245
00:18:44,99 --> 00:18:47,51
so we'd better get started.

246
00:18:47,51 --> 00:18:58,98
So first of all there is what
I will call easy limits.

247
00:18:58,98 --> 00:19:00,65
So what's an easy limit?

248
00:19:00,65 --> 00:19:07,55
An easy limit is something like
the limit as x goes to 4 of (x

249
00:19:07,55 --> 00:19:09,81
3 / x^2

250
00:19:09,81 --> 00:19:11,57
1).

251
00:19:11,57 --> 00:19:16,24
And with this kind of limit all
I have to do to evaluate it is

252
00:19:16,24 --> 00:19:21,48
to plug in x = 4 because,
so what I get here

253
00:19:21,48 --> 00:19:24,26
is 4 + 3 / (4^2

254
00:19:24,26 --> 00:19:27,9
1).

255
00:19:27,9 --> 00:19:31,56
And that's just 7 / 17.

256
00:19:31,56 --> 00:19:33,72
And that's the end of it.

257
00:19:33,72 --> 00:19:38,51
So those are the easy limits.

258
00:19:38,51 --> 00:19:43,07
The second kind of limit, well
so this isn't the only second

259
00:19:43,07 --> 00:19:45,29
kind of limit but I just want
to point this out, it's very

260
00:19:45,29 --> 00:19:55,68
important is that:
derivatives are are always

261
00:19:55,68 --> 00:19:59,37
harder than this.

262
00:19:59,37 --> 00:20:03,23
You can't get away
with nothing here.

263
00:20:03,23 --> 00:20:05,09
So, why is that?

264
00:20:05,09 --> 00:20:08,2
Well, when you take a
derivative, you're taking the

265
00:20:08,2 --> 00:20:20,27
limit as x goes to x0 of f(x),
well we'll write it all

266
00:20:20,27 --> 00:20:24,52
out in all its glory.

267
00:20:24,52 --> 00:20:28,79
Here's the formula
for the derivative.

268
00:20:28,79 --> 00:20:39,11
Now notice that if you plug in
x = x0, always gives 0 / 0.

269
00:20:39,11 --> 00:20:42,08
So it just basically
never works.

270
00:20:42,08 --> 00:20:51,22
So we always are going to need
some cancellation to make

271
00:20:51,22 --> 00:21:05,96
sense out of the limit.

272
00:21:05,96 --> 00:21:12,99
Now in order to make things a
little easier for myself to

273
00:21:12,99 --> 00:21:16,85
explain what's going on with
limits I need to introduce just

274
00:21:16,85 --> 00:21:18,66
one more piece of notation.

275
00:21:18,66 --> 00:21:21,3
What I'm gonna introduce
here is what's known as a

276
00:21:21,3 --> 00:21:23,38
left-hand and a right limit.

277
00:21:23,38 --> 00:21:27,295
If I take the limit as
x tends to x0 with a

278
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:32,63
sign here of some function,
this is what's known as

279
00:21:32,63 --> 00:21:42,28
the right hand limit.

280
00:21:42,28 --> 00:21:44,87
And I can display it visually.

281
00:21:44,87 --> 00:21:45,95
So what does this mean?

282
00:21:45,95 --> 00:21:49,15
It means practically the same
thing as x tends to x0 except

283
00:21:49,15 --> 00:21:52,08
there is one more restriction
which has to do with this

284
00:21:52,08 --> 00:21:55,37
sign, which is we're going
from the plus side of x0.

285
00:21:55,37 --> 00:21:58,71
That means x is bigger than x0.

286
00:21:58,71 --> 00:22:01,77
And I say right-hand, so there
should be a hyphen here,

287
00:22:01,77 --> 00:22:07,64
right-hand limit because on the
number line, if x zero is over

288
00:22:07,64 --> 00:22:14,86
here the x is to the right.

289
00:22:14,86 --> 00:22:15,08
All right?

290
00:22:15,08 --> 00:22:16,75
So that's the right-hand limit.

291
00:22:16,75 --> 00:22:20,13
And then this being the left
side of the board, I'll put on

292
00:22:20,13 --> 00:22:23,454
the right side of the board
the left limit, just to

293
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:24,56
make things confusing.

294
00:22:24,56 --> 00:22:30,52
So that one has the
minus sign here.

295
00:22:30,52 --> 00:22:33,94
I'm just a little dyslexic
and I hope you're not.

296
00:22:33,94 --> 00:22:38,2
So I may have
gotten that wrong.

297
00:22:38,2 --> 00:22:41,51
So this is the left-hand
limit, and I'll draw it.

298
00:22:41,51 --> 00:22:45,705
So of course that just means
x goes to x0 but x is

299
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,26
to the left of x0 .

300
00:22:48,26 --> 00:22:54,27
And again, on the number line,
here's the x0 and the x is

301
00:22:54,27 --> 00:22:56,57
on the other side of it.

302
00:22:56,57 --> 00:22:59,66
Okay, so those two notations
are going to help us to

303
00:22:59,66 --> 00:23:01,83
clarify a bunch of things.

304
00:23:01,83 --> 00:23:06,22
It's much more convenient to
have this extra bit of

305
00:23:06,22 --> 00:23:10,37
description of limits than to
just consider limits

306
00:23:10,37 --> 00:23:15,88
from both sides.

307
00:23:15,88 --> 00:23:25,98
Okay so I want to give
an example of this.

308
00:23:25,98 --> 00:23:30,45
And also an example of how
you're going to think about

309
00:23:30,45 --> 00:23:32,11
these sorts of problems.

310
00:23:32,11 --> 00:23:38,02
So I'll take a function which
has two different definitions.

311
00:23:38,02 --> 00:23:44,085
Say it's x + 1, when
x &gt; 0 and -x

312
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:47,57
2, when x &lt; 0.

313
00:23:47,57 --> 00:23:51,28
So maybe put commas there.

314
00:23:51,28 --> 00:23:58,54
So when x &gt;
0, it's x + 1.

315
00:23:58,54 --> 00:24:01,03
Now I can draw a
picture of this.

316
00:24:01,03 --> 00:24:04,33
It's gonna be kind of little
small because I'm gonna try to

317
00:24:04,33 --> 00:24:07,67
fit it down in here, but maybe
I'll put the axis down below.

318
00:24:07,67 --> 00:24:14,5
So at height 1, I have to the
right something of slope 1

319
00:24:14,5 --> 00:24:16,89
so it goes up like this.

320
00:24:16,89 --> 00:24:18,24
All right?

321
00:24:18,24 --> 00:24:24,12
And then to the left of 0 I
have something which has slope

322
00:24:24,12 --> 00:24:30,72
-1, but it hits the axis
at 2 so it's up here.

323
00:24:30,72 --> 00:24:33,94
So I had this sort of
strange antennae figure

324
00:24:33,94 --> 00:24:35,15
here is my graph.

325
00:24:35,15 --> 00:24:43,71
Maybe I should draw these in
another color to depict that.

326
00:24:43,71 --> 00:24:50,72
And then if I calculate these
two limits here, what I see is

327
00:24:50,72 --> 00:25:00,04
that the limit as x goes to 0
from above of f(x), that's the

328
00:25:00,04 --> 00:25:07,99
same as the limit as x goes to
0 of the formula here, x + 1.

329
00:25:07,99 --> 00:25:10,43
Which turns out to be 1.

330
00:25:10,43 --> 00:25:15,36
And if I take the limit, so
that's the left-hand limit.

331
00:25:15,36 --> 00:25:20,7
Sorry, I told you
I was dyslexic.

332
00:25:20,7 --> 00:25:23,32
This is the right, so
it's that right-hand.

333
00:25:23,32 --> 00:25:25,08
Here we go.

334
00:25:25,08 --> 00:25:32,2
So now I'm going from the left,
and it's f(x) again, but now

335
00:25:32,2 --> 00:25:35,67
because I'm on that side the
thing I need to plug is the

336
00:25:35,67 --> 00:25:43,54
other formula, -x + 2, and
that's gonna give us 2.

337
00:25:43,54 --> 00:25:48,77
Now, notice that the left and
right limits, and this is one

338
00:25:48,77 --> 00:25:51,65
little tiny subtlety and it's
almost the only thing that I

339
00:25:51,65 --> 00:25:54,02
need you to really pay
attention to a little bit right

340
00:25:54,02 --> 00:26:06,21
now, is that this, we did
not need x = 0 value.

341
00:26:06,21 --> 00:26:11,86
In fact I never even told
you what f(0) was here.

342
00:26:11,86 --> 00:26:14,65
If we stick it in we
could stick it in.

343
00:26:14,65 --> 00:26:20,05
Okay let's say we stick
it in on this side.

344
00:26:20,05 --> 00:26:22,97
Let's make it be that
it's on this side.

345
00:26:22,97 --> 00:26:32,86
So that means that this point
is in and this point is out.

346
00:26:32,86 --> 00:26:37,68
So that's a typical notation:
this little open circle

347
00:26:37,68 --> 00:26:41,53
and this closed dot for
when you include the.

348
00:26:41,53 --> 00:26:46,36
So in that case the value of
f(x) happens to be the same as

349
00:26:46,36 --> 00:26:56,53
its right hand limit, namely
the value is 1 here and not 2.

350
00:26:56,53 --> 00:27:01,14
Okay, so that's the
first kind of example.

351
00:27:01,14 --> 00:27:06,61
Questions?

352
00:27:06,61 --> 00:27:13,5
Okay, so now our next
job is to introduce the

353
00:27:13,5 --> 00:27:17,27
definition of continuity.

354
00:27:17,27 --> 00:27:20,08
So that was the
other topic here.

355
00:27:20,08 --> 00:27:23,49
So we're going to define.

356
00:27:23,49 --> 00:27:39,3
So f is continuous at x0 means
that the limit of f(x) as

357
00:27:39,3 --> 00:27:44,44
x tends to x0 = f(x0) .

358
00:27:44,44 --> 00:27:47,09
Right?

359
00:27:47,09 --> 00:27:52,36
So the reason why I spend all
this time paying attention to

360
00:27:52,36 --> 00:27:55,04
the left and the right and so
on and so forth and focusing

361
00:27:55,04 --> 00:27:57,76
is that I want you to pay
attention for one moment to

362
00:27:57,76 --> 00:28:01,82
what the content of
this definition is.

363
00:28:01,82 --> 00:28:12,64
What it's saying is the
following: continuous at x0

364
00:28:12,64 --> 00:28:15,45
has various ingredients here.

365
00:28:15,45 --> 00:28:24,54
So the first one is that
this limit exists.

366
00:28:24,54 --> 00:28:28,23
And what that means is that
there's an honest limiting

367
00:28:28,23 --> 00:28:35,15
value both from the
left and right.

368
00:28:35,15 --> 00:28:39,25
And they also have
to be the same.

369
00:28:39,25 --> 00:28:41,98
All right, so that's
what's going on here.

370
00:28:41,98 --> 00:28:50,38
And the second property is
that f(x0) is defined.

371
00:28:50,38 --> 00:28:53,23
So I can't be in one of these
situations where I haven't

372
00:28:53,23 --> 00:29:05,22
even specified what f(x0)
is and they're equal.

373
00:29:05,22 --> 00:29:09,19
Okay, so that's the situation.

374
00:29:09,19 --> 00:29:13,56
Now again let me emphasize
a tricky part of the

375
00:29:13,56 --> 00:29:15,56
definition of a limit.

376
00:29:15,56 --> 00:29:20,71
This side, the left-hand side
is completely independent, is

377
00:29:20,71 --> 00:29:24,38
evaluated by a procedure which
does not involve the

378
00:29:24,38 --> 00:29:25,07
right-hand side.

379
00:29:25,07 --> 00:29:26,9
These are separate things.

380
00:29:26,9 --> 00:29:32,68
This one is, to evaluate
it, you always avoid

381
00:29:32,68 --> 00:29:34,31
the limit point.

382
00:29:34,31 --> 00:29:37,67
So that's if you like a
paradox, because it's exactly

383
00:29:37,67 --> 00:29:41,68
the question: is it true that
if you plug in x0 you get the

384
00:29:41,68 --> 00:29:44,3
same answer as if you
move in the limit?

385
00:29:44,3 --> 00:29:46,27
That's the issue that
we're considering here.

386
00:29:46,27 --> 00:29:49,01
We have to make that
distinction in order to say

387
00:29:49,01 --> 00:29:55,27
that these are two, otherwise
this is just tautalogical.

388
00:29:55,27 --> 00:29:56,63
It doesn't have any meaning.

389
00:29:56,63 --> 00:29:58,64
But in fact it does have a
meaning because one thing is

390
00:29:58,64 --> 00:30:01,25
evaluated separately with
reference to all the other

391
00:30:01,25 --> 00:30:05,85
points and the other is
evaluated right at the

392
00:30:05,85 --> 00:30:06,87
point in question.

393
00:30:06,87 --> 00:30:12,5
And indeed what these
things are, are exactly

394
00:30:12,5 --> 00:30:18,16
the easy limits.

395
00:30:18,16 --> 00:30:19,77
That's exactly what we're
talking about here.

396
00:30:19,77 --> 00:30:24,15
They're the ones you
can evaluate this way.

397
00:30:24,15 --> 00:30:25,64
So we have to make
the distinction.

398
00:30:25,64 --> 00:30:27,77
And these other ones are
gonna be the ones which we

399
00:30:27,77 --> 00:30:29,67
can't evaluate that way.

400
00:30:29,67 --> 00:30:32,47
So these are the nice ones and
that's why we care about them

401
00:30:32,47 --> 00:30:36,47
why we have a whole definitions
associated with them.

402
00:30:36,47 --> 00:30:38,7
All right?

403
00:30:38,7 --> 00:30:40,4
So now what's next?

404
00:30:40,4 --> 00:30:48,91
Well, I need to give you a a
little tour, very brief tour,

405
00:30:48,91 --> 00:30:54,09
of the zoo of what are known
as discontinuous functions.

406
00:30:54,09 --> 00:30:57,43
So sort of everything else
that's not continuous.

407
00:30:57,43 --> 00:31:04,55
So, the first example here, let
me just write it down here.

408
00:31:04,55 --> 00:31:13,67
It's jump discontinuities.

409
00:31:13,67 --> 00:31:15,3
So what would a jump
discontinuity be?

410
00:31:15,3 --> 00:31:18,73
Well we've actually
already seen it.

411
00:31:18,73 --> 00:31:21,89
The jump discontinuity
is the example that

412
00:31:21,89 --> 00:31:23,23
we had right there.

413
00:31:23,23 --> 00:31:35,26
This is when the limit from
the left and right exist,

414
00:31:35,26 --> 00:31:42,18
but are not equal.

415
00:31:42,18 --> 00:31:51,22
Okay, so that's as
in the example.

416
00:31:51,22 --> 00:31:51,44
Right?

417
00:31:51,44 --> 00:31:53,82
In this example, the two
limits, one of them was

418
00:31:53,82 --> 00:31:57,89
1 and of them was 2.

419
00:31:57,89 --> 00:32:02,15
So that's a jump discontinuity.

420
00:32:02,15 --> 00:32:09,87
And this kind of issue, of
whether something is continuous

421
00:32:09,87 --> 00:32:21,31
or not, may seem a little bit
technical but it is true that

422
00:32:21,31 --> 00:32:26,12
people have worried
about it a lot.

423
00:32:26,12 --> 00:32:30,08
Bob Merton, who was a professor
at MIT when he did his work for

424
00:32:30,08 --> 00:32:35,27
the Nobel prize in economics,
was interested in this very

425
00:32:35,27 --> 00:32:39,86
issue of whether stock prices
of various kinds are continuous

426
00:32:39,86 --> 00:32:42,54
from the left or right
in a certain model.

427
00:32:42,54 --> 00:32:46,53
And that was a very serious
issue in developing the model

428
00:32:46,53 --> 00:32:50,43
that priced things that
our hedge funds use

429
00:32:50,43 --> 00:32:51,84
all the time now.

430
00:32:51,84 --> 00:32:57,63
So left and right can really
mean something very different.

431
00:32:57,63 --> 00:33:01,96
In this case left is the past
and right is the future and it

432
00:33:01,96 --> 00:33:04,29
makes a big difference whether
things are continuous from the

433
00:33:04,29 --> 00:33:06,84
left or continuous
from the right.

434
00:33:06,84 --> 00:33:09,37
Right, is it true that the
point is here, here, somewhere

435
00:33:09,37 --> 00:33:11,72
in the middle, somewhere else.

436
00:33:11,72 --> 00:33:13,48
That's a serious issue.

437
00:33:13,48 --> 00:33:18,45
So the next example that
I want to give you is a

438
00:33:18,45 --> 00:33:22,72
little bit more subtle.

439
00:33:22,72 --> 00:33:32,14
It's what's known as a
removable discontinuity.

440
00:33:32,14 --> 00:33:39,65
And so what this means is
that the limit from left

441
00:33:39,65 --> 00:33:46,19
and right are equal.

442
00:33:46,19 --> 00:33:48,78
So a picture of that would be,
you have a function which is

443
00:33:48,78 --> 00:33:52,5
coming along like this and
there's a hole maybe where, who

444
00:33:52,5 --> 00:33:55,05
knows either the function is
undefined or maybe it's defined

445
00:33:55,05 --> 00:33:58,97
up here, and then it
just continues on.

446
00:33:58,97 --> 00:33:59,25
All right?

447
00:33:59,25 --> 00:34:01,21
So the two limits are the same.

448
00:34:01,21 --> 00:34:05,01
And then of course the function
in begging to be redefined

449
00:34:05,01 --> 00:34:07,37
so that we remove that hole.

450
00:34:07,37 --> 00:34:14,47
And that's why it's called
a removable discontinuity.

451
00:34:14,47 --> 00:34:18,14
Now let me give you an
example of this, or actually

452
00:34:18,14 --> 00:34:22,46
a couple of examples.

453
00:34:22,46 --> 00:34:28,47
So these are quite important
examples which you will be

454
00:34:28,47 --> 00:34:34,02
working with in a few minutes.

455
00:34:34,02 --> 00:34:41,79
So the first is the function
g(x), which is sin x / x, and

456
00:34:41,79 --> 00:34:50,52
the second will be the function
h(x), which is 1 - cos x / x.

457
00:34:50,52 --> 00:35:00,29
So we have a problem at
g(0) , g(0) is undefined.

458
00:35:00,29 --> 00:35:03,97
On the other hand it turns out
this function has what's called

459
00:35:03,97 --> 00:35:05,71
a removable singularity.

460
00:35:05,71 --> 00:35:14,63
Namely the limit as x goes to
0 of sin x / x does exist.

461
00:35:14,63 --> 00:35:17,05
In fact it's equal to 1.

462
00:35:17,05 --> 00:35:19,96
So that's a very important
limit that we will work out

463
00:35:19,96 --> 00:35:22,145
either at the end of this
lecture or the beginning

464
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:23,42
of next lecture.

465
00:35:23,42 --> 00:35:35,37
And similarly, the limit of 1 -
cos x / x, as x goes to 0 is 0.

466
00:35:35,37 --> 00:35:38,44
Maybe I'll put that a
little farther away

467
00:35:38,44 --> 00:35:40,36
so you can read it.

468
00:35:40,36 --> 00:35:45,43
Okay, so these are very useful
facts that we're going

469
00:35:45,43 --> 00:35:47,8
to need later on.

470
00:35:47,8 --> 00:35:51,09
And what they say is that these
things have removable

471
00:35:51,09 --> 00:36:04,6
singularities, sorry removable
discontinuity at x = 0.

472
00:36:04,6 --> 00:36:13,03
All right so as I say, we'll
get to that in a few minutes.

473
00:36:13,03 --> 00:36:16,59
Okay so are there any
questions before I move on?

474
00:36:16,59 --> 00:36:16,9
Yeah?

475
00:36:16,9 --> 00:36:30,63
Student: [INAUDIBLE]

476
00:36:30,63 --> 00:36:38,3
Professor: The question
is: why is this true?

477
00:36:38,3 --> 00:36:40,3
Is that what your question is?

478
00:36:40,3 --> 00:36:44,963
The answer is it's very, very
unobvious, I haven't shown it

479
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:49,67
to you yet, and if you were
not surprised by it then that

480
00:36:49,67 --> 00:36:51,56
would be very strange indeed.

481
00:36:51,56 --> 00:36:53,39
So we haven't done it yet.

482
00:36:53,39 --> 00:36:55,99
You have to stay
tuned until we do.

483
00:36:55,99 --> 00:36:57,21
Okay?

484
00:36:57,21 --> 00:36:59,25
We haven't shown it yet.

485
00:36:59,25 --> 00:37:02,49
And actually even this other
statement, which maybe seems

486
00:37:02,49 --> 00:37:05,76
stranger still, is also
not yet explained.

487
00:37:05,76 --> 00:37:09,33
Okay, so we are going to get
there, as I said, either at

488
00:37:09,33 --> 00:37:15,41
the end of this lecture or
at the beginning of next.

489
00:37:15,41 --> 00:37:22,56
Other questions?

490
00:37:22,56 --> 00:37:29,04
All right, so let me just
continue my tour of the

491
00:37:29,04 --> 00:37:34
zoo of discontinuities.

492
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38,24
And, I guess, I want to
illustrate something with the

493
00:37:38,24 --> 00:37:42,37
convenience of right and left
hand limits so I'll save this

494
00:37:42,37 --> 00:37:52,18
board about right and
left-hand limits.

495
00:37:52,18 --> 00:37:55,445
So a third type of
discontinuity is what's known

496
00:37:55,445 --> 00:38:07,32
as an infinite discontinuity.

497
00:38:07,32 --> 00:38:11,95
And we've already
encountered one of these.

498
00:38:11,95 --> 00:38:14,45
I'm going to draw
them over here.

499
00:38:14,45 --> 00:38:19,37
Remember the function
y is 1 / x.

500
00:38:19,37 --> 00:38:22,45
That's this function here.

501
00:38:22,45 --> 00:38:26,68
But now I'd like to draw also
the other branch of the

502
00:38:26,68 --> 00:38:31,14
hyperbola down here and
allow myself to consider

503
00:38:31,14 --> 00:38:32,32
negative values of x.

504
00:38:32,32 --> 00:38:35,91
So here's the graph of 1 / x.

505
00:38:35,91 --> 00:38:42,82
And the convenience here of
distinguishing the left and the

506
00:38:42,82 --> 00:38:46,62
right hand limits is very
important because here I

507
00:38:46,62 --> 00:38:49,39
can write down that the
limit as x goes to 0

508
00:38:49,39 --> 00:38:51,8
of 1 / x.

509
00:38:51,8 --> 00:38:57,3
Well that's coming from the
right and it's going up.

510
00:38:57,3 --> 00:39:00,58
So this limit is infinity.

511
00:39:00,58 --> 00:39:07,12
Whereas, the limit in the other
direction, from the left,

512
00:39:07,12 --> 00:39:10,63
that one is going down.

513
00:39:10,63 --> 00:39:16,51
And so it's quite different,
it's minus infinity.

514
00:39:16,51 --> 00:39:19,98
Now some people say that these
limits are undefined but

515
00:39:19,98 --> 00:39:22,94
actually they're going in some
very definite direction.

516
00:39:22,94 --> 00:39:26,12
So you should, whenever
possible, specify what

517
00:39:26,12 --> 00:39:26,64
these limits are.

518
00:39:26,64 --> 00:39:30,97
On the other hand, the
statement that the limit as

519
00:39:30,97 --> 00:39:37,25
x goes to 0 of 1 / x is
infinity is simply wrong.

520
00:39:37,25 --> 00:39:40,34
Okay, it's not that
people don't write this.

521
00:39:40,34 --> 00:39:41,68
It's just that it's wrong.

522
00:39:41,68 --> 00:39:43,47
It's not that they
don't write it down.

523
00:39:43,47 --> 00:39:45
In fact you'll probably see it.

524
00:39:45 --> 00:39:47,04
It's because people are
just thinking of the

525
00:39:47,04 --> 00:39:48,79
right hand branch.

526
00:39:48,79 --> 00:39:51,22
It's not that they're making
a mistake necessarily,

527
00:39:51,22 --> 00:39:53,19
but anyway, it's sloppy.

528
00:39:53,19 --> 00:39:56,2
And there's some sloppiness
that we'll endure and others

529
00:39:56,2 --> 00:39:57,08
that we'll try to avoid.

530
00:39:57,08 --> 00:40:00,12
So here, you want to say this,
and it does make a difference.

531
00:40:00,12 --> 00:40:04,99
You know, plus infinity is an
infinite number of dollars

532
00:40:04,99 --> 00:40:07,45
and minus infinity is and
infinite amount of debt.

533
00:40:07,45 --> 00:40:08,98
They're actually different.

534
00:40:08,98 --> 00:40:09,89
They're not the same.

535
00:40:09,89 --> 00:40:13,79
So, you know, this is sloppy
and this is actually

536
00:40:13,79 --> 00:40:15,54
more correct.

537
00:40:15,54 --> 00:40:18,38
Okay, so now in addition,
I just want to point

538
00:40:18,38 --> 00:40:21,35
out one more thing.

539
00:40:21,35 --> 00:40:24,34
Remember, we calculated
the derivative, and

540
00:40:24,34 --> 00:40:26,88
that was -1/x^2.

541
00:40:26,88 --> 00:40:31,71
But, I want to draw the graph
of that and make a few

542
00:40:31,71 --> 00:40:32,57
comments about it.

543
00:40:32,57 --> 00:40:36,91
So I'm going to draw the graph
directly underneath the

544
00:40:36,91 --> 00:40:38,82
graph of the function.

545
00:40:38,82 --> 00:40:41,29
And notice what this graphs is.

546
00:40:41,29 --> 00:40:48,53
It goes like this, it's always
negative, and it points down.

547
00:40:48,53 --> 00:40:52,3
So now this may look a little
strange, that the derivative

548
00:40:52,3 --> 00:40:57,1
of this thing is this guy,
but that's because of

549
00:40:57,1 --> 00:40:58,63
something very important.

550
00:40:58,63 --> 00:41:01,03
And you should always remember
this about derivatives.

551
00:41:01,03 --> 00:41:03,13
The derivative function
looks nothing like the

552
00:41:03,13 --> 00:41:04,86
function, necessarily.

553
00:41:04,86 --> 00:41:07,78
So you should just forget
about that as being an idea.

554
00:41:07,78 --> 00:41:10,33
Some people feel like if one
thing goes down, the other

555
00:41:10,33 --> 00:41:11,47
thing has to go down.

556
00:41:11,47 --> 00:41:13,03
Just forget that intuition.

557
00:41:13,03 --> 00:41:14,16
It's wrong.

558
00:41:14,16 --> 00:41:20,17
What we're dealing with here,
if you remember, is the slope.

559
00:41:20,17 --> 00:41:24,33
So if you have a slope here,
that corresponds to just a

560
00:41:24,33 --> 00:41:29,22
place over here and as the
slope gets a little bit less

561
00:41:29,22 --> 00:41:31,92
steep, that's why
we're approaching the

562
00:41:31,92 --> 00:41:33,32
horizontal axis.

563
00:41:33,32 --> 00:41:36,48
The number is getting a little
smaller as we close in.

564
00:41:36,48 --> 00:41:41,12
Now over here, the slope
is also negative.

565
00:41:41,12 --> 00:41:43,32
It is going down and as we
get down here it's getting

566
00:41:43,32 --> 00:41:44,58
more and more negative.

567
00:41:44,58 --> 00:41:48,27
As we go here the slope, this
function is going up, but

568
00:41:48,27 --> 00:41:50,05
its slope is going down.

569
00:41:50,05 --> 00:41:55,79
All right, so the slope is down
on both sides and the notation

570
00:41:55,79 --> 00:42:03,69
that we use for that is well
suited to this left

571
00:42:03,69 --> 00:42:09,41
and right business.

572
00:42:09,41 --> 00:42:16,45
Namely, the limit as x goes to
0 of -1 / x^2, that's going to

573
00:42:16,45 --> 00:42:18,14
be equal to minus infinity.

574
00:42:18,14 --> 00:42:21,41
And that applies
to x going to 0

575
00:42:21,41 --> 00:42:24,76
and x going to 0-.

576
00:42:24,76 --> 00:42:31,78
So both have this property.

577
00:42:31,78 --> 00:42:34,34
Finally let me just make
one last comment about

578
00:42:34,34 --> 00:42:37,66
these two graphs.

579
00:42:37,66 --> 00:42:43
This function here is an odd
function and when you take the

580
00:42:43 --> 00:42:45,33
derivative of an odd function
you always get an

581
00:42:45,33 --> 00:42:50,74
even function.

582
00:42:50,74 --> 00:42:54,38
That's closely related to the
fact that this 1 / x is an odd

583
00:42:54,38 --> 00:43:01,17
power and x^1 is an odd power
and x^2 is an even power.

584
00:43:01,17 --> 00:43:05,62
So all of this your intuition
should be reinforcing the fact

585
00:43:05,62 --> 00:43:11,07
that these pictures look right.

586
00:43:11,07 --> 00:43:16,74
Okay, now there's one last kind
of discontinuity that I want to

587
00:43:16,74 --> 00:43:27,46
mention briefly, which I will
call other ugly

588
00:43:27,46 --> 00:43:33,99
discontinuities.

589
00:43:33,99 --> 00:43:39,77
And there are lots
and lots of them.

590
00:43:39,77 --> 00:43:44,42
So one example would be
the function y = sin 1

591
00:43:44,42 --> 00:43:50,08
/ x, as x goes to 0.

592
00:43:50,08 --> 00:43:59,29
And that looks a
little bit like this.

593
00:43:59,29 --> 00:44:00,33
Back and forth and
back and forth.

594
00:44:00,33 --> 00:44:06,17
It oscillates infinitely
often as we tend to 0.

595
00:44:06,17 --> 00:44:19,26
There's no left or right
limit in this case.

596
00:44:19,26 --> 00:44:25,33
So there is a very large
quantity of things like that.

597
00:44:25,33 --> 00:44:29,35
Fortunately we're not gonna
deal with them in this course.

598
00:44:29,35 --> 00:44:32,62
A lot of times in real life
there are things that oscillate

599
00:44:32,62 --> 00:44:35,94
as time goes to infinity, but
we're not going to worry

600
00:44:35,94 --> 00:44:40,18
about that right now.

601
00:44:40,18 --> 00:44:49,4
Okay, so that's our final
mention of a discontinuity, and

602
00:44:49,4 --> 00:44:56,38
now I need to do just one more
piece of groundwork for

603
00:44:56,38 --> 00:44:59,36
our formulas next time.

604
00:44:59,36 --> 00:45:09,13
Namely, I want to check
for you one basic fact,

605
00:45:09,13 --> 00:45:10,28
one limiting tool.

606
00:45:10,28 --> 00:45:12,96
So this is going
to be a theorem.

607
00:45:12,96 --> 00:45:17,72
Fortunately it's a very
short theorem and has

608
00:45:17,72 --> 00:45:19,58
a very short proof.

609
00:45:19,58 --> 00:45:22,09
So the theorem goes under
the name differentiable

610
00:45:22,09 --> 00:45:28,21
implies continuous.

611
00:45:28,21 --> 00:45:33,89
And what it says is the
following: it says that if f is

612
00:45:33,89 --> 00:45:41,88
differentiable, in other words
its the derivative exists at

613
00:45:41,88 --> 00:45:59,84
x0, then f is continuous at x0.

614
00:45:59,84 --> 00:46:02,47
So, we're gonna need this is as
a tool, it's a key step in the

615
00:46:02,47 --> 00:46:05,75
product and quotient rules.

616
00:46:05,75 --> 00:46:12,38
So I'd like to prove
it right now for you.

617
00:46:12,38 --> 00:46:16,27
So here is the proof.

618
00:46:16,27 --> 00:46:20,43
Fortunately the proof
is just one line.

619
00:46:20,43 --> 00:46:24,12
So first of all, I want to
write in just the right

620
00:46:24,12 --> 00:46:27,41
way what it is that
we have to check.

621
00:46:27,41 --> 00:46:31,64
So what we have to check is
that the limit, as x goes

622
00:46:31,64 --> 00:46:41,39
to x0 of f(x) - f(x0) = 0.

623
00:46:41,39 --> 00:46:42,68
So this is what
we want to know.

624
00:46:42,68 --> 00:46:45,9
We don't know it yet, but
we're trying to check

625
00:46:45,9 --> 00:46:47,65
whether this is true or not.

626
00:46:47,65 --> 00:46:50,735
So that's the same as the
statement that the function is

627
00:46:50,735 --> 00:46:54,66
continuous because the limit of
f(x) is supposed to be f(x0)

628
00:46:54,66 --> 00:46:59,69
and so this difference
should have limit 0.

629
00:46:59,69 --> 00:47:03,97
And now, the way this is
proved is just by rewriting

630
00:47:03,97 --> 00:47:09,72
it by multiplying and
dividing by (x - x0).

631
00:47:09,72 --> 00:47:18,15
So I'll rewrite the limit as x
goes to x0 of (f(x) - f(x0)

632
00:47:18,15 --> 00:47:25,57
/ by x - x0) (x - x0).

633
00:47:25,57 --> 00:47:29,23
Okay, so I wrote down the same
expression that I had here.

634
00:47:29,23 --> 00:47:31,67
This is just the same limit,
but I multiplied and

635
00:47:31,67 --> 00:47:38,07
divided by (x - x0).

636
00:47:38,07 --> 00:47:45,25
And now when I take the limit
what happens is the limit of

637
00:47:45,25 --> 00:47:48,83
the first factor is f'(x0).

638
00:47:48,83 --> 00:47:53,94
That's the thing we know
exists by our assumption.

639
00:47:53,94 --> 00:48:00,37
And the limit of the second
factor is 0 because the

640
00:48:00,37 --> 00:48:06,7
limit as x goes to x0 of
(x - x0) is clearly 0 .

641
00:48:06,7 --> 00:48:09,21
So that's it.

642
00:48:09,21 --> 00:48:12,21
The answer is 0, which
is what we wanted.

643
00:48:12,21 --> 00:48:14,98
So that's the proof.

644
00:48:14,98 --> 00:48:19,9
Now there's something
exceedingly fishy looking about

645
00:48:19,9 --> 00:48:26,37
this proof and let me just
point to it before we proceed.

646
00:48:26,37 --> 00:48:33,05
Namely, you're used in limits
to setting x equal to 0.

647
00:48:33,05 --> 00:48:35,88
And this looks like we're
multiplying, dividing by 0,

648
00:48:35,88 --> 00:48:40,82
exactly the thing which makes
all proofs wrong in all kinds

649
00:48:40,82 --> 00:48:43,52
of algebraic situations
and so on and so forth.

650
00:48:43,52 --> 00:48:45,78
You've been taught that
that never works.

651
00:48:45,78 --> 00:48:47,75
Right?

652
00:48:47,75 --> 00:48:52,71
But somehow these limiting
tricks have found a way around

653
00:48:52,71 --> 00:48:55,88
this and let me just make
explicit what it is.

654
00:48:55,88 --> 00:49:03,5
In this limit we never
are using x = x0.

655
00:49:03,5 --> 00:49:06,11
That's exactly the one
value of x that we don't

656
00:49:06,11 --> 00:49:09,12
consider in this limit.

657
00:49:09,12 --> 00:49:11,91
That's how limits
are cooked up.

658
00:49:11,91 --> 00:49:15,91
And that's sort of been the
themes so far today, is that we

659
00:49:15,91 --> 00:49:18,96
don't have to consider that and
so this multiplication and

660
00:49:18,96 --> 00:49:21,45
division by this
number is legal.

661
00:49:21,45 --> 00:49:25,2
It may be small, this number,
but it's always non-zero.

662
00:49:25,2 --> 00:49:28,21
So this really works, and it's
really true, and we just

663
00:49:28,21 --> 00:49:32,56
checked that a differentiable
function is continuous.

664
00:49:32,56 --> 00:49:38,93
So I'm gonna have to carry out
these limits, which are very

665
00:49:38,93 --> 00:49:42,04
interesting 0 / 0
limits next time.

666
00:49:42,04 --> 00:49:46,03
But let's hang on for one
second to see if there any

667
00:49:46,03 --> 00:49:47,96
questions before we stop.

668
00:49:47,96 --> 00:49:48,99
Yeah, there is a question.

669
00:49:48,99 --> 00:49:53,45
Student: [INAUDIBLE]

670
00:49:53,45 --> 00:50:00,97
Professor: Repeat this
proof right here?

671
00:50:00,97 --> 00:50:02,83
Just say again.

672
00:50:02,83 --> 00:50:08,23
Student: [INAUDIBLE]

673
00:50:08,23 --> 00:50:13,21
Professor: Okay, so there are
two steps to the proof and

674
00:50:13,21 --> 00:50:17,87
the step that you're asking
about is the first step.

675
00:50:17,87 --> 00:50:18,58
Right?

676
00:50:18,58 --> 00:50:21,1
And what I'm saying is if
you have a number, and you

677
00:50:21,1 --> 00:50:24,64
multiply it by 10 / 10
it's the same number.

678
00:50:24,64 --> 00:50:26,92
If you multiply it by 3 /
3 it's the same number.

679
00:50:26,92 --> 00:50:30,11
2 / 2, 1 / 1, and so on.

680
00:50:30,11 --> 00:50:32,48
So it is okay to change
this to this, it's

681
00:50:32,48 --> 00:50:34,4
exactly the same thing.

682
00:50:34,4 --> 00:50:36,35
That's the first step.

683
00:50:36,35 --> 00:50:36,72
Yes?

684
00:50:36,72 --> 00:50:41,56
Student: [INAUDIBLE]

685
00:50:41,56 --> 00:50:45,01
Professor: Shhhh...

686
00:50:45,01 --> 00:50:52,51
The question was how does the
proof, how does this line, yeah

687
00:50:52,51 --> 00:50:53,96
where the question mark is.

688
00:50:53,96 --> 00:50:56,5
So what I checked was that this
number which is on the left

689
00:50:56,5 --> 00:51:02,58
hand side is equal to this very
long complicated number which

690
00:51:02,58 --> 00:51:06,27
is equal to this number which
is equal to this number.

691
00:51:06,27 --> 00:51:08,87
And so I've checked that this
number is equal to 0 because

692
00:51:08,87 --> 00:51:12,12
the last thing is 0.

693
00:51:12,12 --> 00:51:16,12
This is equal to that is
equal to that is equal to 0.

694
00:51:16,12 --> 00:51:17,6
And that's the proof.

695
00:51:17,6 --> 00:51:17,92
Yes?

696
00:51:17,92 --> 00:51:21,91
Student: [INAUDIBLE]

697
00:51:21,91 --> 00:51:30,58
Professor: So that's a
different question.

698
00:51:30,58 --> 00:51:36,04
Okay, so the hypothesis of
differentiability I use

699
00:51:36,04 --> 00:51:39,42
because this limit is
equal to this number.

700
00:51:39,42 --> 00:51:40,52
That that limit exits.

701
00:51:40,52 --> 00:51:44,17
That's how I use the
hypothesis of the theorem.

702
00:51:44,17 --> 00:51:47,84
The conclusion of the theorem
is the same as this because

703
00:51:47,84 --> 00:51:52,65
being continuous is the same
as limit as x goes to

704
00:51:52,65 --> 00:51:56,02
x0 of f(x) = f(x0).

705
00:51:56,02 --> 00:51:57,53
That's the definition
of continuity.

706
00:51:57,53 --> 00:52:02,15
And I subtracted f(x0) from
both sides to get this

707
00:52:02,15 --> 00:52:02,86
as being the same thing.

708
00:52:02,86 --> 00:52:06,46
So this claim is continuity
and it's the same as

709
00:52:06,46 --> 00:52:10,35
this question here.

710
00:52:10,35 --> 00:52:11,18
Last question.

711
00:52:11,18 --> 00:52:16,97
Student: How did you
get the 0 [INAUDIBLE]

712
00:52:16,97 --> 00:52:18,52
Professor: How did we
get the 0 from this?

713
00:52:18,52 --> 00:52:20,88
So the claim that is being
made, so the claim is why

714
00:52:20,88 --> 00:52:24,67
is this tending to that.

715
00:52:24,67 --> 00:52:27,41
So for example, I'm going
to have to erase something

716
00:52:27,41 --> 00:52:28,73
to explain that.

717
00:52:28,73 --> 00:52:35,24
So the claim is that the limit
as x goes to x0 of x - x0 = 0.

718
00:52:35,24 --> 00:52:37,16
That's what I'm claiming.

719
00:52:37,16 --> 00:52:39,49
Okay, does that answer
your question?

720
00:52:39,49 --> 00:52:40,99
Okay.

721
00:52:40,99 --> 00:52:42,42
All right.

722
00:52:42,42 --> 00:52:45,37
Ask me other stuff
after lecture.

723
00:52:45,37 --> 00:52:46,18
