1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,850

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,610
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,050
In this video, I'd like us
to work on an example of

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,080
something you actually saw in
one of the lecture videos, and

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,790
that's about reduction
formulas.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,010
So what I'd like us to do is
to find a reduction formula

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,930
for the integral of sine to the
nx dx, which I'm denoting

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,270
by f sub n of x.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,640
That's actually, f sub n of x
denotes the integral of sine x

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,620
raised to the n dx.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,190
So the object here, just to
remind you of what we'd like

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,490
to do, is to be able to write
f sub n of x in a form where

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,580
maybe it involves some
functions, but any integral

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,520
that it involves is an integral
of sine to a lower

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,040
power than n.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,040
So an integral of sine x to
a lower power than n.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,030
So that's the object.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,360
The object is to write this down
in such a way that this

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,620
integral is equal to some
functions maybe, product of

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,630
some functions added to another
function that's like

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,190
f, but with a lower subscript.

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,680
So I'm going to give you a
little time to work on it.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,330
Why don't you pause the video,
take some time to work on it,

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,500
and when I come back, I'll
show you how I do it.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:24,670

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,030
OK.

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,890
Welcome back.

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,240
Well, hopefully you were
able to make some

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,260
headway on this problem.

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,400
So let's take a look again at
what we want to do, what the

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,440
goal is, and then we'll
figure out a good

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,940
strategy to do that.

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,450
So the goal is to be able
to write f sub n of x as

34
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,490
something that involves
a lower numbered

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,730
subscript than n.

36
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,000
Right?

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,570
So we'd like to be able to take
this integral, that's a

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,520
power of sine x, and reduce
the number of powers.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,420
You know, it would be great if
we could just write down a

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,200
final formula, but if we're able
to reduce the power of

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,010
sine x, then we're able to head
in a direction where we

42
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,740
could start to write down, start
to write this down as

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,710
functions that don't
involve integrals.

44
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,900
So the first step in these kinds
of things is finding a

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,450
reduction formula.

46
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,480
So a couple of things
I want to remind us.

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,310
We're going to make the common
substitution that we make for

48
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,420
powers of sign or powers of
cosine that we see a lot.

49
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,790
Well, I guess, actually
there's two.

50
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,250
When you just see a sine
squared, sometimes you do this

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,530
half angle formula, or double
angle formula, that Joel has

52
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,560
mentioned in some videos.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,720
But in this one, we're more
interested in manipulating the

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,780
identity, sine squared x plus
cosine squared x equals one.

55
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,080
In particular, we're going to
replace one of the sine

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,810
squared x's, or we're going to
replace two of the sines by 1

57
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,170
minus cosine squared x.

58
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,490
So that'll be our first step.

59
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,980
So we're going to do
that substitution.

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,470
We'll break it into
some pieces, we'll

61
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,600
see where we get.

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,870
OK?

63
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,150
So let me come over here, and
I will start the problem.

64
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,980
So I'm starting with f sub n of
x, and I'm going to rewrite

65
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:14,180
it as the integral of sine to
the n minus 2x quantity 1

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,600
minus cosine squared x dx.

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,740
So let me take a step back.

68
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,730
So what did we do here?

69
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,050
We took two powers of sine, and
we replaced them by what I

70
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,680
said earlier.

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,250
We replaced them by 1 minus
cosine squared x.

72
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,640
Right?

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,270
So this is a sine squared x.

74
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,490
Here I have sine x
to the n minus 2.

75
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,270
When multiply those together,
I get sine x to the n.

76
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,440
So everything's still
working out so far.

77
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,510
Why is this good?

78
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,850
Well, notice the terms we have.
Sine to the n minus 2 x

79
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:56,800
dx minus the integral of sine
to the n minus 2x cosine

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,640
squared x dx.

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,830
OK.

82
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,970
This we like.

83
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,860
Why do we like this?

84
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,300
Because it's actually is just
like the f sub n of x, except

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,930
it has a lower power.

86
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,590
So this piece is actually
f sub n minus 2 of x.

87
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,820
So that's something we like.

88
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,220
Because it's already reduced
the power of sine x by 2.

89
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,820
So that's good.

90
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,670
That's part of the
reduction idea.

91
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,900
This one, obviously we can't
write it in terms of capital F

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,990
with some subscript.

93
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,430
And it maybe doesn't look so
easy to integrate right away.

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,940
But let's think about it for a
second, how we could split

95
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,800
this thing up.

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,750
And the goal was to use an
integration by parts.

97
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,210
So we're going to examine this
integral in particular.

98
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,280
So let me just write that
one down again here.

99
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,270
So we need to analyze--

100
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm going to drop the
minus sign for the

101
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,990
moment, n minus 2.

102
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,590

103
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,100
So our goal, again, is to try
and write this somehow.

104
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,790
Either manipulate it so it
looks like a capital F

105
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,760
function, or manipulate
it so that the

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,380
integral sign is gone.

107
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,660
OK?

108
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,540
That's our main goal here.

109
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,540
So let's look at what
we can do with this.

110
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,860
Well, I can split this up.

111
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,810
What I'm going to do, it's kind
of tricky, but what I'm

112
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,670
going to do, is I'm going to
take all of the sine x's, and

113
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,770
I'm going to take one
of the cosine x's.

114
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,160
And I'm going to make that one
thing, and I'm going to make

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,640
the other cosine x
another thing.

116
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,810
And I'm going to write them down
first, and we'll figure

117
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,760
out which is a good u and
which is a good v prime.

118
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,700

119
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,530
So that's going to
be one thing.

120
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,990
And then the other cosine
x is going to be--

121
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,840
does that look like
an equals sign?

122
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,800
Equals is going to be
the other thing.

123
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,230
So again, sine to the n minus 2x
times cosine x times cosine

124
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,880
x gives me what's up here,
inside the integral.

125
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,220
And now what I really want to
see, I'm going to use an

126
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,710
integration by parts.

127
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,130
Well, this is easy to
integrate or take

128
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,840
a derivative of.

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,530
But the point is that now
I can integrate this.

130
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,390
And why can I integrate this?

131
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,730
Well, I can do a substitution
on this.

132
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,520
So this is kind of
complicated.

133
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,700
Because there's first, you have
to notice, an integration

134
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,790
by parts is a good way
to go with this.

135
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,180
And then you have to see, oh my
goodness, one of the steps

136
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,820
of integration by parts
requires substitution.

137
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,710
So it's a little tricky.

138
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,290
But I'm going to make this,
then, my v prime, and I'm

139
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,920
going to make this my u.

140
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,970
Now, I'm going to come over to
the other board to figure out,

141
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,510
just to make sure I do
the v prime right.

142
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,090
OK?

143
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,180
And then I'm going to finish
off this problem.

144
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,550
So we'll come back
here in a second.

145
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,060
So right now, this is
a question mark.

146
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,430
We're going to make sure we do
the v prime part right, and

147
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,980
then we're going to write down,
this should be uv minus

148
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,970
the integral of vdu.

149
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,890
OK?

150
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,520
So let me give myself
some space.

151
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,710
So I'm trying to integrate
now sine the n

152
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,822
minus 2x cosine x dx.

153
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:05,390
All right?

154
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,310
That's my integral
of v prime dx.

155
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,470
OK, so this will give me v.

156
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,540
Well, let's see what we do.

157
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,600
We're going to now make--

158
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,260
I don't want to use a u for
my substitution, because I

159
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,720
already have in my mind a u.

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:27,050
So I'm going to let w equal sine
x, and then dw is equal

161
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,920
to cosine x dx.

162
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,380
Right?

163
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,710
What's the point here?

164
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,250
Why do we see this as
easy to integrate?

165
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,160
Because this is powers of sine,
and the derivative of

166
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,260
sine is cosine.

167
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,330
So that's why this
lends itself to a

168
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,040
substitution so easily.

169
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,310
So that should be fairly
familiar by now, but just to

170
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,570
make sure we're clear.

171
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,400
So then this is now the
integral of w to

172
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,896
the n minus 2 dw.

173
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,590
All right?

174
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,600
I have sine x to
the n minus 2.

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,580
So that's replaced by
w to the n minus 2.

176
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,750
And then dw replaces
cosine x dx.

177
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,590
And that is pretty easy
to integrate, I think.

178
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,630
That's w to the n minus
1 over n minus 1.

179
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,570
I'm not going to worry about
my c's right now.

180
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,890
That'll come up right
at the end.

181
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,440
We'll put in a plus
c if we needed to.

182
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,710

183
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,190
But, so don't worry
about your plus c.

184
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,060
I don't want to carry
that around.

185
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,340
OK.

186
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,540
So then when I when I look at
this, what does this tell me?

187
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,600
This tells me that if this is
the integral of v prime, this

188
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,020
tells me that v is equal to sine
x to the n minus 1, sine

189
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,080
to the n minus 1x
over n minus 1.

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
OK?

191
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,490
This whole bit was to help us in
the middle of the problem.

192
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,646
So this was the v we needed.

193
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,840
All right?

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,960
So let's come back, fill in a
little piece we needed, that

195
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,110
little gap we had, and then
we'll finish the problem on

196
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,250
the far right.

197
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,390
So let's come back.

198
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,510
Where was I?

199
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,670
OK.

200
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,080
So I was integrating
this quantity.

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Sine to the n minus 2x
cosine squared x dx.

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,110
And I was trying to use
integration by parts.

203
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,610
So I had u and v prime, and I've
now calculated v, and I

204
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,510
know what du is.

205
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,880
So I'm going to write down
what this equals.

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,470
This is going to be u,
which is cosine x.

207
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,210
And I'll just write down
v here, so we'll

208
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,730
see what it is again.

209
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,160
Times sign to the n minus
1 x over n minus 1.

210
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,870
And then I have to
subtract v du.

211
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,230
So this is v. And what's du?

212
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,800
du is, or I should say,
u prime is how

213
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,110
you saw it in class.

214
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,590
u prime is negative sine x.

215
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,560
So what am I going to get?

216
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,870
I'm going to get negative sine
x times the v that I had.

217
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,305
So when I subtract, I'm going
to end up with a plus sign.

218
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:45,990
And I'm going to have plus,
I'm going to pull out the

219
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,220
constant, 1 over n minus 1,
integral, now let's look at

220
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,110
the magic that happens here.

221
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,250
OK.

222
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,910
Let's make sure you agree
with this power.

223
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,130
It's the nth power of sine x.

224
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,230
So let's double check.

225
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,550
I said u was cosine x, so u
prime is negative sine x.

226
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,380
So I have to take u prime v.
u prime is negative sine x.

227
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:18,040
If we come over here, we see v
is sine x to the n minus 1, so

228
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,050
u prime v is indeed negative--

229
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,480
well, I should say, v is the
sine x to the n minus 1

230
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,750
over n minus 1.

231
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,390
So u prime v, in fact, has
the power n on sine.

232
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,140
So that's maybe a little bit
complicated and nerve-racking,

233
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,160
but that's OK.

234
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,580
We're actually headed in
the right direction.

235
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,970
So I'm going to rewrite the
stuff we know, and we'll see

236
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,085
how we're headed in the
right direction.

237
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,340
OK.

238
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,430
So again, we were trying
to find f sub n of x.

239
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,780
And I'm going to write out the
pieces we already knew.

240
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,080
So we had an f sub
n minus 2 of x.

241
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,030
That was the first
term we had.

242
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,300
And then we analyzed
this second piece.

243
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,110
And the second piece is the
one that we just spent a

244
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,960
little while on.

245
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:10,270
And that gave us a cosine x,
sine to the n minus 1 of x

246
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:18,420
over n minus 1, and then a
plus 1 over n minus 1.

247
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,630
And what was our thing here?

248
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,290
Our thing here was f
sub n of x, again.

249
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:23,550
OK.

250
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,960
So this might be a little
complicated.

251
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,250
So I'm going to show us where
all the pieces come

252
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,620
from, just remind us.

253
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,870
So we started with f sub n of x,
and I'm claiming there are

254
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,420
two pieces that are
of interest. OK?

255
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,450
The first piece--

256
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,030
let's come back over.

257
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,750
The first piece, this was
our f sub n of x.

258
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,580
We wrote it this way.

259
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,890
The first piece was the
f sub n minus 2 of x.

260
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,280
Sine to the n minus 2 of x.

261
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,490
No problem.

262
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,060
Then we subtracted
this integral.

263
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,280
And so I spent a little while
trying to figure out how to

264
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,490
write that integral.

265
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,650
And that integral was written
right down here.

266
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,430
So I have to subtract
off all of that.

267
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,070
And the point is that this
integral here, integral of

268
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,250
sine x to the n, the quantity of
sine x to the n, is f sub n

269
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,910
of x, again.

270
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,880
Now you might be nervous,
because again, we just said,

271
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,570
we see the same thing over--

272
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,490
we see what we want to reduce
on the right hand side.

273
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,060
But now all we have to do
is a little algebra.

274
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,200
So I'm going to come over and
show you the magic of algebra.

275
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,540
OK?

276
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,730
Let's, to make this as easy as
possible, I'm going to erase

277
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,280
the parentheses here, and put
that minus sign here, so I

278
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,680
don't have to rewrite
the whole line.

279
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,350
OK?

280
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,750
So the parentheses are gone,
and I've distributed the

281
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,280
negative 1 to both terms. Now
notice, I want to figure out

282
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,530
what this is.

283
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,630

284
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm going to figure out what
that blue thing equals.

285
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,470
Well, we're back to sort
of an algebra problem.

286
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,850
We can isolate the blue things,
and solve for what's

287
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,200
in the blue box.

288
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,260
So that's what we're
going to do.

289
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,180
So what do we have to do?

290
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,080
Well, we have to add this
to the left hand side.

291
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,850
And what do we get?

292
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,620
Let's see what we get.

293
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,120
We get 1 plus 1 over
n minus 1.

294
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:24,060
F sub n of x is equal to F sub
n minus 2 of x minus cosine x

295
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,170
sine x quantity to the n
minus 1 over n minus 1.

296
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,315
So all I did was I added 1 over
n minus 1 times F sub n

297
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,560
of x to the left hand side--

298
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,310
well, to both sides, so it moved
to the left hand side--

299
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,960
and there was one of them here,
and there's 1 over n

300
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,230
minus 1 of them here.

301
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,000
And let's make sure we
can simplify that.

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,300
Let's see.

303
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,970
We get n minus 1 over
n minus 1 plus 1.

304
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,780
I think it gives me
n over n minus 1.

305
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,660
So that gives me n
over n minus 1.

306
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,060
I guess I'll write it again.

307
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,310
We're really close.

308
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,140

309
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,579
And then this whole
mess again.

310
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:11,270

311
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,020
And now, we only have one more
step to figure out what

312
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,850
F sub n of x is.

313
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:22,290
And that is to multiply both
sides by n minus 1 over n.

314
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,100
n minus 1 over n multiplied here
gives me 1, and so then I

315
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:34,140
get n minus 1 over n, F sub
n minus 2 of x, minus--

316
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:41,690
the n minus 1's kill off, and
I just get cosine x sine to

317
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,790
the n minus 1 x over n.

318
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,520
So this is our answer.

319
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,580
Because what is the point?

320
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,620
Why can I say, well,
I've reduced it?

321
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,280
I've reduced it because I have--
the only integral I

322
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,570
have is an integral that
was a power of sine x.

323
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,100
And that's the goal, is that
I have it in the form.

324
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,010
This is the power of sine
x to the n integrated.

325
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,360
This is sine x to the n
minus 2 integrated.

326
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
and this is just a function.

327
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,080
OK?

328
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,100
And, you know, if we want
to say, what's the true

329
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,570
antiderivative, we have to allow
for a plus c here, for a

330
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,640
true antiderivative.

331
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,520
But we're really interested
in this part here.

332
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:28,850
OK?

333
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,410
Because if we evaluate
this at bounds,

334
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,450
that's going to go away.

335
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,540
But I want to just make
sure we understand--

336
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,520
I think we understand
the goal.

337
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,960
Maybe the hardest part of this
problem is once you come over

338
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,250
here, was once you have
these two components.

339
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,180
So we did the substitution
that seems natural.

340
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,370
You have these two components.

341
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,350
This one, you should be able
to recognize, is in

342
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,480
the form you want.

343
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,390
This one is the hard
one to deal with.

344
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,340
But the trick is to see that
under the right splitting up

345
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,340
of these functions, one of them
is easy to integrate, and

346
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,410
one of them, you know, it's easy
to integrate or take a

347
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,250
derivative.

348
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,270
So I have a little
bit of freedom.

349
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,870
You don't want to substitute
back in for cosine squared

350
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,190
with 1 minus sine squared,
because it will get you right

351
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,380
back to where you started.

352
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,180
You would be substituting
one way, and then

353
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,710
substituting the other way.

354
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,110
So the goal at this point is
to sort of-- the trick with

355
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,090
this one, I mean, is
disintegration by parts, which

356
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,520
requires some substitution.

357
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,140
So hopefully this was a good
exercise for you, and you see

358
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,540
some of the strategies that
one needs to reduce the

359
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,810
powers of sine x.

360
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,660
You can do a very similar
type of thing with

361
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,250
cosine x to the n.

362
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,900
So if you felt like, I'm not
quite sure about this method,

363
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,860
you might want to try and do
something similar with cosine

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,430
x to the n as your function that
you're integrating, and

365
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,290
see if you can reduce that.

366
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,720
And I guarantee you can find a
formula for that in a book or

367
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,040
online, if you wanted to
check that answer.

368
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,610
So I guess this is
where I'll stop.

369
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:01,688
