00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,370
Hi.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,100
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,550
In class, one of the things
you've talked about recently

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,640
was computing surface areas
of solids of rotation.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,140
So I have a nice problem
relating to that here.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,590
So the circle with center R, 0
and radius little r-- so this

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,040
is center big R, 0, and radius
little r, which is

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,190
less than big r--

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,660
is rotated around the y-axis.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,090
And the question is, what's
the surface area of the

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,180
resulting solid?

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,140
So we have here the circle.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,260
Its center is at the point big
R, 0, and its radius is little

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,980
r, so this is the equation
of that circle.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,660
And we're going to rotate this
circle around this axis.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,810
So we're going to
spin it around.

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,330
And what you're going to
get is a donut, or what

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,900
mathematicians call a torus.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,690
So here's a little schematic
of it here, with one dotted

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,540
little cross section
corresponding to this circle.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,950
So the question is, what
is the surface

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,320
area of this torus?

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,510
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes to

25
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,920
work this problem out yourself,
come back, and we

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,170
can work it out together.

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:17,270

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,390
So when we solved surface area
problems in class, we took the

29
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,790
curve that we were going to
rotate, and we cut it into

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,830
lots of little pieces
with length ds.

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,860
So let me draw that, just
very quickly, up here.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,850
So we had, you took whatever
your curve was, and you cut it

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,080
into lots of these
little segments.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,090
And then for each segment, you
rotated it around an axis.

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,050
And so if the segment has this
little length ds, a little

36
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,880
piece of arc length--

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,150
so in our case, we're going to
rotate it around the y-axis,

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,840
so the length, the area that
this thing traces out as it

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,550
spins around, is going to be
this little piece of area, da,

40
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,620
which is equal to 2 pi x ds.

41
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,740
Now, this is a little bit
different than most of the

42
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,990
examples Professor Jerison did
in class, because here we're

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,000
rotating around the y-axis,
not around the x-axis.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,810
So if you rotated around the
x-axis, what you would

45
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,410
get is 2 pi y ds.

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,850
And here we get 2 pi x ds.

47
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,770
The idea of the x and the y in
this formula, this x, it's

48
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,850
just telling you what the radius
is between your little

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,020
segment, and the axis around
which you're rotating it.

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,540
So here this is, you know, 2 pi
x is the circumference of

51
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,340
this circle that it traces out,
and ds is its length,

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,340
because it's giving
you a little

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,050
ribbon as it goes around.

54
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,740
So we have this formula,
da equals 2 pi x ds.

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,990
And so in order to get the
surface area, what we do, is

56
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,070
we have to integrate this over
an appropriate region.

57
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,260
So in order to do that, we first
need, you know, all the

58
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,070
variables in the integrand to
be the same, so we need to

59
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,580
write everything in terms of x,
or everything in terms of

60
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,380
y, or everything in terms of
some variable that we can

61
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,010
integrate against.

62
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:19,490
So in our particular case with
this torus, I think we can

63
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,540
take advantage of a little bit
of symmetry here, which is

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,280
that this, you know, torus is
top-bottom symmetric, right?

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,650
As the top half of the circle
goes around, it

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,035
traces out one surface.

67
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:34,780
As the bottom half of the circle
goes around, it traces

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,930
out another surface.

69
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,850
But those two surfaces have
exactly the same area.

70
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,280
They're just mirror images of
each other, because the circle

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,060
is symmetric.

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,020
So we can just consider the
problem of spinning the top

73
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,230
half of the circle around.

74
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,970
And so for the top half of the
circle, we can write down an

75
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,610
equation for y in terms of x,
and so then we can integrate,

76
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,950
you know, that sets up a nice
integral with respect to x.

77
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,700
So in order to do
this, well we're

78
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,490
going to need two things.

79
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,980
So we're going to need
to know what ds is.

80
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,280
And so you had a couple
of different

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,240
formulas for this in class.

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,150
So you had ds--

83
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,160
so one easy mnemonic that I like
is to write ds equals the

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,040
square root of dx squared
plus dy squared.

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,750
So for me, this always--

86
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,110
I can remember this, because
it's just the Pythagorean

87
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,750
theorem, right?

88
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,080
So you have a little dx
horizontal distance, and a

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,420
little dy vertical distance,
and so the ds is just a

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,520
hypotenuse of that triangle.

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,740
So that's how I remember this.

92
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,950
And so then you also have the
equivalent formula if you

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,580
factor out a dx from here.

94
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, divide through by dx
and multiply outside by dx.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,950
You can write this as the square
root of 1 plus dy by dx

96
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,160
squared times, outside
the square root, dx.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,300
So this is our little
piece ds.

98
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,440
And OK, we have an x in
the formula already.

99
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,160
So ds--

100
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,970
so we now have ds
with a dx here.

101
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,680
So the only thing we have left,
is we need to figure out

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,590
what dy dx is in order to put
all this into the formula, in

103
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,080
order to integrate.

104
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,510
So OK.

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,860
So dy dx.

106
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,650
So OK, so that means I
need y in terms of x.

107
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,030
Now let--

108
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,230
OK.

109
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,700
So if we're focusing only on
the top half of this torus,

110
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,930
that means y--

111
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,930
well, we can solve this equation
for y, but when we

112
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,540
take the square root, we're
only taking the positive

113
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,010
square root, because we're only
looking at the top half

114
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,360
of the torus, and then we'll
just double at the end to

115
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,290
account for the bottom
half as well.

116
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,780
So this is y equals the
square root of--

117
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,990
so you solve, you subtract
x minus r

118
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,370
squared from both sides.

119
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,710
So this is little r squared
minus x minus big R squared.

120
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,290
So that's y.

121
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,910
And now you can differentiate
to get dy by dx.

122
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,330
All right.

123
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,100
So now we have to do our
chain rule, right.

124
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,210
So we've got a 1/2 the power.

125
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,870
So this is 1/2 times--

126
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,220
well, it's going to be the
inside to the minus 1/2.

127
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,800
So this is over the square
root of r squared minus x

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,920
minus r quantity squared, and
now I need to multiply by the

129
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,750
derivative of the inside,
which is minus 2

130
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,950
times x minus r.

131
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,310
OK.

132
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,480
And the 2's cancel out a little
bit, so we can rewrite

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:58,080
this as minus x minus r divided
by the square root of

134
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,170
little r squared minus
x minus r squared.

135
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,470
OK.

136
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,760
So that's dy dx.

137
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,010
The square root-- that's a
little ugly, but it's OK,

138
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,940
because we're about to
square it out again.

139
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,780
So all right.

140
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,750
So we've got dy dx.

141
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,760
So now we go back, now we can
compute ds, and then with ds,

142
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,570
we can go even further back,
and we can compute da.

143
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,130
And once we've got da, to get
a, we just integrate da over

144
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,250
the appropriate bounds.

145
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,990
So-- which we haven't figured
out yet, by the way.

146
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,324
We will have to talk about
that at the very,

147
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,650
you know, in a minute.

148
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:33,890
OK.

149
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,650
So we take this, so
we have dy dx.

150
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,840
So from dy dx, we get
ds is equal to--

151
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,740
it's the square root of, well,
let's use this formula.

152
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,340
It's the square root of 1 plus,
now, dy dx squared.

153
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,650
OK.

154
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,010
So I put this in and
I square it.

155
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,820
So I get x minus r
squared on top.

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,750
You know, you square the minus
sign, gives you 1.

157
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,800
And on the bottom, we square
the square root, so we get

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:15,660
little r squared minus x minus
r squared, OK, dx.

159
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,420
Great.

160
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,730
Good.

161
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,730
So now we add these two things
together, right?

162
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,320
I mean, well we want to--

163
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,270
I should say-- we
want to simplify

164
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,050
this to a usable form.

165
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,240
And so to put it in a usable
form, well we're going to

166
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,500
manipulate it until it looks
nice, or as nice as

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,630
we could hope for.

168
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,660
And in this case, right.

169
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,910
So we can, there's an obvious
simplification, or simplifying

170
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,990
step, which is we can add this
1 into the fraction.

171
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,820
OK.

172
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,640
And so this is little r squared
minus x minus big R

173
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,500
squared, over little r squared
minus x minus big R squared,

174
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,720
and so when you add it to x
minus big R squared over

175
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,580
little r squared minus
x minus big R

176
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,300
squared, this part cancels.

177
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,600
And so you're left with--

178
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,900
OK.

179
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,430
And now I'm just going to pass
the square root through right

180
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,320
away, so this is little r over
the square root of little r

181
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:14,140
squared minus x minus
big R squared dx.

182
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,440
OK.

183
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,780
So just a little bit
of algebra there.

184
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,130
So this is ds.

185
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,820
Now, OK, so now we're going,
we want to compute surface

186
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,730
area, so we need da, and
da is 2 pi x times ds.

187
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,290
So--

188
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,530
OK.

189
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,080
So that's easy to write down
now that I've got ds.

190
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:46,300
So this is da equal to 2 pi r x
over r squared minus x minus

191
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,880
big R squared, square
root of that dx.

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,230
All right.

193
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,850
This is da.

194
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,950
You know, we haven't done
any calculus, actually.

195
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,650
Oh, I guess we took a derivative
somewhere.

196
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,460
We haven't done any
integration yet.

197
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,072
Now, to compute the surface
area, we just integrate this.

198
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:10,350
So we get to, you know, the
calculus step of this problem.

199
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,140
So integrate this.

200
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,240
But of course, you know,
I'm expecting a

201
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,170
number out at the end.

202
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,020
I'm taking a definite
integral.

203
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,650
So I need bounds.

204
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,190
Well, what bounds do I need?

205
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,580
Well, I'm integrating
with respect to x.

206
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,310
So I need to integrate over
the relevant values of x.

207
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,080
What are the relevant
values of x?

208
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,680
Well, come back to our
picture over here.

209
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320

210
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,310
We have this circle.

211
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,840
Its center is at x equals
R, y equals 0.

212
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,280
And has the radius little r.

213
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,220
So, you know, the relevant
values of x are just from the

214
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,580
leftmost point of the circle
to the rightmost

215
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,770
point of the circle.

216
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,200
And so this leftmost point is
just-- well, the radius is

217
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,350
little r, so this is big R minus
x equals big R minus

218
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,450
little r, and the rightmost
point is x equals big

219
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,520
R plus little r.

220
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,390
So the bounds--

221
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,890
so I'm going to go up here--

222
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,645
so I have area, is what I
get when I integrate da.

223
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:14,480
And I want to integrate it
from x equals big R minus

224
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,430
little r to big R plus little
r, and da is this thing I

225
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,840
found, just a moment ago.

226
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,140
So this is--

227
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,660
well, OK.

228
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,970
So 2 pi little r
is a constant.

229
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,350
I'm just going to factor
that out in front.

230
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:39,620
So this is 2 pi little r times
x over the square root of

231
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,320
little r squared minus
big R minus--

232
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,115
sorry--

233
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:51,130
x minus big R squared.

234
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,950
That's all under the
square root ds.

235
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,290
OK.

236
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,840
So now we have to figure out how
to integrate this thing.

237
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,510
Right?

238
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,730
So this is a little ugly.

239
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,970
It's not horrible, though.

240
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,280
Right?

241
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,060
So down here we have something
that's really reminiscent of

242
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,790
one of these trig integral
things we've done.

243
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:13,990
Right?

244
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,890
We've got a square root of a
something squared minus a

245
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,280
something else squared.

246
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,270
So that, reminds, you know, what
does that remind, maybe

247
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,740
some sine substitution.

248
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,950
Something like that.

249
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,860
There's some there's some
trig substitution

250
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,240
waiting to happen here.

251
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,960
But, so OK.

252
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,040
We could sort of shoot to do
it all in one substitution.

253
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,060
I like, my life always feels
simpler when I do one little

254
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,500
substitution at a time.

255
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,540
And so one little substitution I
could do is to simplify this

256
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,700
x minus r thing.

257
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,600
I could just shift this by r.

258
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,560
So I'm just going to do a little
linear substitution.

259
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:58,810
I'm going to do u equals x minus
big R, or I'm going to

260
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,970
want to substitute the other
way, so that's the same thing

261
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:11,460
as saying x equals u plus big
R. And so du equals dx.

262
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,110
This is a simple little
substitution.

263
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,110
And I'm going to have to move
the bounds, so when x is big R

264
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,300
minus little r, then u is minus
little r, and this top

265
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
bound here, u is going to
be equal to little r.

266
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,620
Positive little r.

267
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,810
So let me just make
that substitution.

268
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,960
So area is 2 pi little r,
integral from minus little r

269
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,880
to plus little r.

270
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:45,230
So x is u plus big R divided
by, now this thing becomes

271
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,510
square root of little r squared
minus u squared du.

272
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,880

273
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,280
OK, all right.

274
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,330
So now--

275
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,100
this is really kind of two
separate pieces, right, for

276
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,190
purposes of difficulty
of integrating.

277
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,740
There's the u over the square
root of r squared minus u

278
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,100
squared piece, and there's the
big R over the square root of

279
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,640
r squared minus u
squared piece.

280
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,440
So let's think about
them separately.

281
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,370
So for this first piece, the u
over the square root of little

282
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,930
r squared minus u
squared, this is

283
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,390
something you can integrate.

284
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,260
This is a, you don't need a trig
substitution to do that.

285
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,750
But it's actually--

286
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,230
you don't need to do any
work to do that.

287
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,290
Because that function u divided
by square root of

288
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,280
little r squared minus
u squared,

289
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,110
that's an odd function.

290
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,860
Right?

291
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,220
This part, the denominator is
even, u is odd, and we're

292
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,870
integrating over an
interval that's

293
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,260
symmetric around the origin.

294
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,610
So when we integrate this u
divided by this denominator

295
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,600
part between u from minus
r to r, that's just

296
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,700
going to give 0.

297
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,410
So I can forget about
that entirely.

298
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,450
So this is nice.

299
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,720
And then I'll have a constant
here, so I'm going to factor

300
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,740
that out as well.

301
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:13,400
So I get 2 pi little r big R,
integral from minus r to r of

302
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,700
du over the square
root of little r

303
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,780
squared minus u squared.

304
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,400

305
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,190
OK.

306
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,320
Good.

307
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,700
So far, so good.

308
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,770
So we've got this
nice simplified

309
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,710
form for the integral.

310
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,270
So now this is screaming out
trig substitution to me.

311
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:34,590
Right?

312
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,680
There's nothing else I can do.

313
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,650
So there's sort of two
things you could do.

314
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,650
One is you could recognize this
as an integral related to

315
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,080
arc sine, just because
you remember that.

316
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,850
The other is, you have this r
squared minus u squared thing.

317
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,720
And so r squared minus u
squared, that needs a trig

318
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,390
substitution of some sort, and
the relevant trig substitution

319
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,300
that you would want to do, is
you would want to set u equal

320
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:07,430
to r sine t.

321
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,790
Why?

322
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,630
Because then down here we'll
have r squared minus r squared

323
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,380
sine t, or if you factor out
the little r, that's just 1

324
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,980
minus sine squared t, which is
cosine squared t, and then you

325
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,810
take a square root, and you're
all good, right?

326
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,300
Square root of cosine
squared t.

327
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,820
OK.

328
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,660
So we find this trig
substitution.

329
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,220
So if we do u equals r
sine t, that's good.

330
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:39,750
So du then is r cosine t dt,
and I need to change the

331
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,060
bounds, so minus u is equal to
minus r when sine of t is

332
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,800
equal to minus 1.

333
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,700
So that's at minus pi over 2.

334
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,810
And u is equal to r when sine
of t is equal to 1.

335
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,360
So that's a pi over 2.

336
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,540
So this is equal to 2 pi little
r big R integral from

337
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:12,740
minus pi over 2 to pi over 2 of
r cosine t dt divided by--

338
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:12,980
OK.

339
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,500
So then down here, we have the
square root of r squared minus

340
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,420
r squared sine squared t.

341
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,030

342
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,560
And as we said, so r squared
minus r squared

343
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,440
sine squared t.

344
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,950
This is r squared cosine
squared t.

345
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,370
And then you take a square
root, and you just

346
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,970
get r cosine t.

347
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,280
And so r cosine t cancels
r cosine t.

348
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,040
So the integrand here is
actually 1, or 1 dt.

349
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,670
So that's really easy
to integrate.

350
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,770
You integrate a constant,
you just get--

351
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,850
well, the constant times the
length of the integral.

352
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:55,990
So this is equal to 2 pi r R
times the constant is 1, times

353
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,780
the length of the integral,
which is another pi times pi.

354
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,080
OK.

355
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:10,050
So this is equal to 2 pi squared
little r big R. But

356
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,950
remember, so far we've only
computed-- this is just the

357
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,910
top half of the torus, is all
we've ever talked about.

358
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,210
So we want to get the whole
torus, you just double this.

359
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,200
So you double this, and you
get the area of the whole

360
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,140
torus is 4 pi squared
little r big R,

361
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,330
which is a nice formula.

362
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,750
So quickly, just to summarize
what we've done.

363
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,220
Standard setup.

364
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,600
Here we did it, we're rotating
around the y-axis instead of

365
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,100
the x-axis.

366
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,290
So this formula for da looks a
little bit different than what

367
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,340
you saw in class, mostly.

368
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,740
But the thing to remember is
just that what goes here is

369
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,930
the radius that this, that your

370
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,130
little segment is traveling.

371
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,360
And this is the circumference
that it's traveling, and so

372
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,930
this is the area of
that little ribbon

373
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,690
that it traces out.

374
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,520
So da--

375
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,930
OK.

376
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,490
And then we just did, you know,
the sort of usual thing.

377
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,010
For your formula, you need--
you know, you remember the

378
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,440
formula for ds.

379
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,230
Then you needed to find this
derivative and plug it in.

380
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,700
And so after you've done all
that preparatory work then you

381
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,700
have your integrand set up.

382
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,520
And once you set up your
integrand, you do whatever

383
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,070
integration tools you
can to hit it with.

384
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,700
So in our case, that was
simplifying substitution, and

385
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,660
then a nice observation that we
used here to simplify this,

386
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,330
that this part was odd.

387
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,170
I mean, you could've--

388
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,690
you didn't need that
observation.

389
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,220
You could have done the problem
perfectly well with

390
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,810
another substitution there to
kill off that first part.

391
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,690
And then, OK, and then a trig
substitution, remembering that

392
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,240
this is an ar sine, or related
to an arc sine,

393
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,490
to finish it off.

394
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,170

395
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,520
And is there anything
else I want to say?

396
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,830
I think that's-- oh, yes.

397
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,850
There's one other thing I wanted
to say, which is that

398
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,340
we could have done this
slightly differently.

399
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,960
Which is, here we solved for
y explicitly in terms of x.

400
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,230
And it would have been possible
to carry this through

401
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,690
using implicit differentiation
instead.

402
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,600
It would have actually
simplified--

403
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,400
I would have had to write this
square root of little r

404
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,340
squared minus x minus big R
quantity squared fewer times

405
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,280
if I'd done implicit
differentiation, starting from

406
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,290
this implicit equation
relating x and y.

407
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,150
You have to be a little careful
there, whether you're

408
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,990
doing the whole circle all at
once, or just the top half or

409
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,630
the bottom half.

410
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,870
But you could do it with
implicit differentiation

411
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,570
instead, and maybe save yourself
a little bit of

412
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,640
messy-looking arithmetic.

413
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,770
So I think I'll end there.

414
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,122
