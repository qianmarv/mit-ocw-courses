1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,580
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,280
In this video, I want
us to practice

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,520
doing integration again.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,910
And so what we're going to do
is two problems. One is a

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,640
definite integral, one
is indefinite.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,930
So this integral, we're going to
have, find the value of the

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,020
integral minus pi over 4 to pi
over 4 of secant cubed u du,

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,550
and then this one, I just want
you to actually just find an

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,030
antiderivative, then, for 1
over 2 sine u cosine u.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,210
So why don't you take a while
to work on this, pause the

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,600
video, and then when you're
ready, restart the video, and

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,920
I will come back and show
you how I did it.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:52,480

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,720
OK.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,820
Welcome back.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,870
So again, we're going to work
on finding, in this one, a

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,230
specific number, and in this
one, an antiderivative.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,200
So we'll start off with the
integral from minus pi over 4

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,410
to pi over 4 of secant
cubed u du.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,110
And the first thing I'm going
to do, is I'm going to drop

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,970
the bounds and just find the
function I need, and then I'll

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,990
bring the bounds back in.

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,230
I don't want to write the bounds
down at every step.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,380
I'm not doing any substitution,
I don't think.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,320
So I don't need to worry
about if I'm changing

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,080
the bounds or not.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,120
So I'll keep the bounds the
same, but I won't write them

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,660
down again until near the end.

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,430
All right.

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,660
So let's look at
this integral.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,030
So the easiest way, I think,
to start an integral like

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,880
this, is to split it up
into secant u and then

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,290
secant squared u.

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,460
Maybe there are some other ways
you did it, but when I

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,340
was looking at this problem, the
way I saw was to start off

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,880
and write this as secant
u times 1--

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,910
oops, let me make sure, yes--

39
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,230
times 1 plus tan squared u du.

40
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,640
Because secant squared
u is equal to 1 plus

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,210
tangent squared u.

42
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,500
And what does it do for us?

43
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,970
Well, it partially answers
the question, but not

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,450
completely, we'll see.

45
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,900
So what it does first, is it
gives us something we can find

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,680
pretty easily.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,040
The first one, we just get the
integral of secant u du.

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,740
We know that one.

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,850
The second one is a little
harder, because we get the

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:29,650
integral of secant u tangent
squared u du.

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,560
And this has promise, but
it's not going to work

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,300
for us right away.

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,550
Because, you know, the
derivative of tangent is

54
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,670
secant squared, and
the derivative of

55
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,920
secant is secant tangent.

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,890
So a substitution won't work in
this case, because neither

57
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,390
one of these functions is a
derivative of the other one.

58
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,020
If I even move off of tangent,
and I have secant tangent

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,830
times another tangent, it's
not the right derivative.

60
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,820
A tangent's derivative
is secant squared.

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,712
So my main point here is that a
u substitution doesn't work,

62
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:04,490
or the the substitution
strategy doesn't work.

63
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,900
So what we're going to do, is
we're actually going to take

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,710
this part, and make it into an
integration by parts problem.

65
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,550
So this is going to be, I'm
going to stop writing equals

66
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,110
signs, I'm going to figure out
the integral of this one.

67
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,770
So this is a little sidebar, and
I'm going to look at the

68
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,830
integral of secant u
tangent squared u.

69
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,900

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,600
And the way I'm going to write
that, is I'm going to write

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,340
that as secant u tangent u will
be one function I want.

72
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,980
We'll call that w,
I guess, v prime.

73
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,700
We can use v prime.

74
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,340
And then what the usual thing
we call u, we'll call w.

75
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,490
So tangent u we'll call w.

76
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,800
And I want to write down, I want
to explain to you why I'm

77
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,840
picking these, and sort of where
this is going to get us.

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,000
So this is an easy thing to
take an antiderivative of.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,320
Right?

80
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,990
I can take this.

81
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,270
I know v is going
to be secant u.

82
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,630
Because the derivative
of secant u is

83
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,980
secant u tangent u.

84
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,540
And then w is tangent u, w prime
is secant squared u.

85
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,230
So if you think about,
what does an

86
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,420
integration by parts have?

87
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,520
It's going to have vw minus
the integral of v w prime.

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,590
That's a lot to take in.

89
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,340
But the point is that that
integral is going to have the

90
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,580
antiderivative of this, which is
secant, and the derivative

91
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,280
of this, which is
secant squared.

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,700
So it's going to have
a secant cubed.

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,980
Which might seem weird, because
now we're getting back

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,590
to what we started with.

95
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,630
But the sign on the secant cubed
is going to be opposite.

96
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,470
Again, this is a
lot of talking.

97
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,590
But let's figure out now.

98
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,450
I just want to show you where
we're headed with this, why I

99
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,780
picked the things I did.

100
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,700
So as I mentioned-- let me
just write these down--

101
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:01,260
secant u is equal to v,
and secant squared u

102
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,160
is equal to w prime.

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,090
Sorry if that looks a little
weird, but that's a u.

104
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,360
OK.

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,520
So now let's write this with
an integration by parts.

106
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:18,350
I get vw, which is secant u
tangent u minus the integral

107
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,830
of vdw, which is secant
cubed u du.

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:30,030

109
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,790
So this is what I was trying
to show you we were

110
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,970
anticipating.

111
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,110
So when I put this all together,
I replace this

112
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,940
integral by these two things.

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,050
And what's the point there?

114
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,000
Notice what I have. If I
actually look at the pieces, I

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,670
have, up here, I have
a secant cubed u.

116
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,030
It's going to equal secant
u plus this--

117
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,860
I have to evaluate that
as the bounds--

118
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,430
minus this.

119
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,670
So I have the same thing on this
side that I had on the

120
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,560
other side, but with
a minus sign.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,490
So if I add it to the other
side, I'm going

122
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,880
to get two of them.

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
So this was sort of where
we're headed.

124
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Now let's put it all together.

125
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760
Let's take it back.

126
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,400
So this stuff here
is that, right?

127
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,020
That's what we did.

128
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,830
I'm going to write just the
important stuff right here.

129
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,080
I've got the integral of secant
cubed u du is equal to

130
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,590
secant u tangent u.

131
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,130

132
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,310
Plus that secant--

133
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,880
I forgot to put that one in, so
let me write in that one.

134
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:43,040
Plus the integral of secant u
du minus secant cubed u du.

135
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,290
The integral of secant
cubed u du.

136
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,770

137
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,300
OK?

138
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,880
And now I'm going to
work some magic.

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,660
I'm actually going to erase
something and move it to the

140
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,720
other side.

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,690
So let me sneak an eraser
off screen.

142
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm going to add this
to the other side.

143
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,730
And what's going to happen?

144
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,510

145
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,120
I come over here and
I get two of them.

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,660
Right?

147
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,270
There was one on this side,
with a minus sign.

148
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,330
I added it, and now I
have two of them.

149
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,440
And now what's the magic?

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,630
Well, I just divide
everything by 2.

151
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,940
And so this is going to
be over 2, and this is

152
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,100
going to be over 2.

153
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,720
And now I know what an
antiderivative is.

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,570
Notice I haven't put in the plus
C, because I'm about to

155
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,590
put in some bounds.

156
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,840
All right?

157
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,700
And by the way, I know
antiderivative of secant u.

158
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,140
So we'll get to that
in one second.

159
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,280
But hopefully everyone
follows.

160
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,320
I had an integral of secant
cubed u on this side.

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,820
I had a minus integral of secant
cubed u over here.

162
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,320
I added it to the other side.

163
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,040
It gave me two of them, so
then I just divided by 2.

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,890
All right?

165
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,890
And now let me just explicitly
write down the

166
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,140
last thing we need.

167
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,720

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,930
We still need this one.

169
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,180
And this is going to be 1/2
natural log absolute value

170
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,910
secant u plus tangent u.

171
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,170
OK.

172
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,780
So now we just have to evaluate

173
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,540
everywhere and we're done.

174
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,490
So now we have to evaluate
all of this.

175
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,630
Remember, I said I left
out the bounds.

176
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:18,830
The bounds are pi over 4 minus
pi over 4, pi over 4

177
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,760
minus pi over 4.

178
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,060
All right.

179
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,360
So I'm going to give myself a
little cheat sheet up here,

180
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,560
and then I'm going to write down
the numbers I get here.

181
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,630
So my cheat sheet is to remind
myself that secant of plus or

182
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,775
minus pi over 4 is equal
to square root 2.

183
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:41,060
Let me just make sure
that's right.

184
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,440
Cosine pi over 4 is 1
over square root 2.

185
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,700
Cosine is even, so plus
or minus pi over

186
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,690
4 will be the same.

187
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,160
Secant is 1 over that,
so I'm good.

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,490
Tangent of pi over 4.

189
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,190
Well, tangent is odd, so I
should say plus or minus here,

190
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,950
tangent is odd, so it's going
to be, they're going to have

191
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,620
two different signs.

192
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,920
Tangent pi over 4 is sine pi
over 4 over cosine pi over 4.

193
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,530
It's the same value there.

194
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,430
So it's 1.

195
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,720
So tangent plus or minus pi
over 4 is plus or minus 1.

196
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,530
So that's what we're
working with.

197
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,530
So now let's start
plugging in.

198
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,530
Secant pi over 4 tangent pi
over 4 gives me root 2

199
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,860
times 1 over 2.

200
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,860
So I get root 2 over 2,
is the first thing.

201
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,360
So I have to write--

202
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
this equals is from here.

203
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,490
So I have root 2 over 2.

204
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,200
And then secant minus pi over
4 is again root 2, tangent

205
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,040
minus pi over 4 is minus 1.

206
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,310
So I have minus, I have a
negative here, and then I have

207
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,740
a 1 here, or a root 2 here,
negative 1 over 2.

208
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,800
So I get another negative,
so I have a plus.

209
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,380
So one negative came from, I was
using the lower bound, and

210
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,830
one negative came from
the tangent.

211
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,740
That gave me a plus.

212
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,960
And then I have plus 1/2.

213
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,190
Well, again.

214
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,920
Natural log of secant pi over
4 is going to be-- so I'm

215
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,140
going to have natural log of
root 2 plus 1, and I'm going

216
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,470
to have a natural log
of root 2 minus 1.

217
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,510
And I'm going to have a negative
in between them.

218
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,005
So I'm going to work a
little magic here.

219
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:21,350
It's going to be natural
log of 2 plus 1 over

220
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,730
root 2 minus 1.

221
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,750
Now, just to point out, where
did that come from?

222
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,310
That came from putting in root
2 for both of the pi over 4s

223
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,830
and minus pi over 4.

224
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,170
Tangent pi over 4
was the plus 1.

225
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,590
Tangent of negative pi over
4 was the minus 1.

226
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,110
How do I get this division?

227
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,500
I had natural log of something
minus natural log

228
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,860
of something else.

229
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,630
So in the end, I get root 2 plus
1/2 natural log absolute

230
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,330
root 2 plus 1 over
root 2 minus 1.

231
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,230
All right.

232
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,470
That is part A. So part
A, let me just remind

233
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,550
you, what did we do?

234
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,060
We had secant cubed u.

235
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,280
We did a substitution for one
of the, for secant squared.

236
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,800
We got something we could deal
with, and something that

237
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,270
didn't look so promising, but
once we did an integration by

238
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,730
parts, we were back to
what we started with,

239
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,780
with a different sign.

240
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,810
So we moved it to
the other side.

241
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,920
We were basically able to solve
for secant cubed u.

242
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,120
So we got all the way
through, and then

243
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,150
we just had to evaluate.

244
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,190
So the big step was, once you
were here, knowing an

245
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,890
integration by parts actually
would save you.

246
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,680
That's sort of the hard
thing to see.

247
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,300
Takes a little while to
see that one, maybe.

248
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,510
All right.

249
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,780
So now the next one.

250
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,390
If we come back here, we're
trying to find an

251
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,530
antiderivative of 1 over
2 sine u cosine u.

252
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,720
And there may be some other ways
to do this, but actually,

253
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,080
this problem, part of the reason
I wanted to do this

254
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,760
problem, was I wanted to remind
you that it's good to

255
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,370
know some of the basic
trigonometric identities,

256
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,670
because it'll make your
life a lot easier.

257
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,510
So this integral is actually the
same as is the integral of

258
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,470
du over sine 2u.

259
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,010
And the reason is, there's a
trigonometric identity that

260
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,060
says, 2 sine u cosine u
is equal to sine 2u.

261
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,570
So I wanted to give you a reason
for why we know those,

262
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,640
why we know some of those
identities, and you end up in

263
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,300
these situations.

264
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,220
There might be other ways to
handle this one, but the

265
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,120
easiest, most direct way
is if you do this.

266
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,650
You change it so that b is
actually the same thing as

267
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,860
integral of du over sine 2u.

268
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,230
So it's just a straight up
double angle formula, you can

269
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,690
call it if you need
a fancy name.

270
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,670
And now what is this?

271
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,960
Well, this is equal to the
integral of what's 1 over

272
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,130
sine, is going to be cosecant.

273
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,930
Cosecant 2u du.

274
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,910
And we know the antiderivative
to cosecant u.

275
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,300
We know that that's going to
be negative natural log of

276
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,500
cosecant u plus cotangent u.

277
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,980
But the problem is,
when there's a 2

278
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,880
there, what do we do?

279
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,940
Well, just think about it as, if
you had the antiderivative,

280
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,950
you know by the chain rule,
if you just put in two u's

281
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,570
everywhere there was a u when
you took the derivative, you

282
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,220
would end up with an
extra 2 in front.

283
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,950
So you have to, basically
you have to just

284
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,830
put in 1/2 in front.

285
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,830
You could do a substitution to
check this, but it's really

286
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,820
straightforward to say, this
antiderivative is equal to

287
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:35,020
negative 1/2 natural log
absolute cosecant 2u plus

288
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,270
cotangent 2u.

289
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,400

290
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,150
Now that I have that written
out, I'll just point out

291
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,310
again, if there was no 2 here,
the 1/2 wouldn't be here, and

292
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,720
we'd just have cosecant u
cotangent u inside here.

293
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,960
But once we have to have the 2
to get a cosecant 2u in the

294
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,310
end, we also need to divide by
2 to kill it off when we take

295
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,220
a derivative.

296
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,330
The chain rule would give
us a 2 in front, so the

297
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,940
1/2 kills it off.

298
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,800
So we don't end up with, you
know, with this not here, the

299
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,590
derivative of this
is 2 cosecant 2u.

300
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,980
So we divide by 2,
then we get it.

301
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,190
We get the right answer.

302
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,820
So this one--

303
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,910
you know, I'm not intentionally

304
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,850
trying to trick you.

305
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,620
I just want to point out that
it's good to know some of

306
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,870
these trigonometric
identities.

307
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,150
It makes solving these
problems a lot

308
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,470
easier to deal with.

309
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,150
So the main point of this one
was actually knowing the

310
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,630
identity, in my mind.

311
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,490
Maybe you found another
way to do it.

312
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,810
Probably it didn't take
two lines, though.

313
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,350
So if you found other way to
do it, actually, it's good.

314
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,220
It's creative.

315
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,250
And I like that.

316
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,590
But I was hoping to convince you
that sometimes it's simple

317
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,950
to know a few of these
identities.

318
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,450
And that is where I will stop.

319
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:45,552
