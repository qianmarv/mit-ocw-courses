00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,420
Hi.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,900
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,660
We've been talking in class a
little bit about parametric

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,210
equations and arc length.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,490
So let's do an example of a
problem where you compute an

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,690
arc length of a curve given by
some parametric equations.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,760
So in particular, I have here
the parametric equations y

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,380
equals t minus 1 over t, and x
equals t plus 1 over t for 1

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,620
less than or equal to t, less
than or equal to 2.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,890
So those parametric equations
trace out some piece of a

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,110
curve in the plane.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,040
And what I'd like you to do is
write down an integral whose

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
value is equal to the arc
length of that curve.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,930
So the integral you're going to
get is going to be pretty

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,320
hard to evaluate.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
So I wouldn't recommend you
spend a whole lot of time

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,350
trying to evaluate it.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,590
But just so we see that we, you
know, we can do this, and

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,300
so we have the integral whose
value is the arc length.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,680
So take a few minutes, work on
that, pause the video, come

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,120
back, and we can work
on it together.

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:20,000

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,320
All right.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,230
So I hope you've had some luck
working this problem.

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,870
Let's get started
on it together.

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,520
So in order to compute the arc
length by an integral, we need

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,200
to figure out what the element
of arc length is, that

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,590
little piece ds.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,120
So this was true when we had our
curve given in rectangular

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,160
coordinates, and it's also true
when our curve is given

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,750
in parametric coordinates.

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,800
So in general, the little
element of arc length is given

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:56,320
as ds equals the square root of
dx squared plus dy squared.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,690
Now, when our curve is given
in rectangular coordinates,

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,710
usually what we do here is we
factor out a dx squared, and

37
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,540
then we have dx by dy,
the derivative of y

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,510
with respect to x.

39
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,200
But here, we don't have
x or y given in terms

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
of the other one.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,240
We have them both given in terms
of this parameter, t.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,460
So the parameter t is the
thing, is our sort of

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,640
independent variable.

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,310
It's the thing we're going to
want to end up integrating

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,040
with respect to.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,010
So what we actually want to do
in this case, is we want to

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,520
factor out a dt from
everywhere.

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,710
So if you factor out a dt,
what this becomes--

49
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,030
or dt squared, I guess
I should say--

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:46,930
is that you get dx dt squared
plus dy dt squared, the whole

51
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,970
thing square root dt.

52
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,200
OK.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,520
So this is just a little
algebraic manipulation

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,820
involving differentials.

55
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,940
And what this gives me is an
expression that will, you

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,490
know, x is a function of t. x
is given as a function of t,

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,450
right here.

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,640
So dx dt is a function of t, and
similarly, y is given as a

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,770
function of t.

60
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,560
So dy dt is a function of t.

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,070
So this whole expression is a
function of t, so we have a

62
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,760
function of t dt.

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,580
So it's all set up
to be integrated.

64
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,350
So in order to actually, you
know, compute with this

65
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,600
formula, well, we just take our
y, and we take our x, and

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,660
we take their derivatives.

67
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,860
So from--

68
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,290
well, I guess we could start
with a y, since it's on top

69
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,050
over there.

70
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,160
So dy dt.

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,860
Well, you know.

72
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,760
You just take a derivative.

73
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,020
Right?

74
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,970
So you have y is equal
to t minus 1 over t.

75
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,130
And you take a derivative
of that.

76
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,920
Derivative of t is just 1,
derivative of 1 over t is

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,700
minus 1 over t squared, so this
becomes-- but there's an

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,520
extra minus sign there,
so this becomes 1

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,620
plus 1 over t squared.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,780
And similarly, dx by
dt is equal to 1

81
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,520
minus 1 over t squared.

82
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,660
So you have these
two derivatives.

83
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,110
So to compute arc length, you
plug them into this formula

84
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,820
for the element of arc length,
and then you'll integrate.

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,670
So OK.

86
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,760
So we have to put them
into that formula.

87
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,420
So what do we get?

88
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,500
We have ds is equal to the
square root of, well, so dx dt

89
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,490
squared plus dy dt squared.

90
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:34,508
So that's 1 minus 1 over t
squared squared, plus 1 plus 1

91
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,365
over t squared squared.

92
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:39,970

93
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,190
dt outside.

94
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,550
OK.

95
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,040
And so now we, you know, maybe
we can simplify this a little.

96
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,100
I would probably expand
out, at this point.

97
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,400
So if you expand this
out, this is--

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,860
well, let's see.

99
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,360
The first one is just is 1 minus
2 over t squared plus 1

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,820
over t to the fourth, plus--

101
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,470
that's the first one we expanded
out, and the second

102
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,040
one, we get 1 plus 2 over
t squared plus 1

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,865
over t to the fourth.

104
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,860

105
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,170
All right.

106
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,300
And if we put all this together,
say, over a common

107
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,960
denominator, and simplify it a
little bit, we can see that

108
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,130
this is equal to--

109
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,000
over t squared terms cancel
out, and we end up with

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,260
something like square root of t
to the fourth plus 1 over t

111
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,530
squared dt.

112
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:35,780
OK.

113
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,020
So this is all this ds that
we've been playing with.

114
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,360
So the actual arc length
is what we get when

115
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,690
we integrate ds.

116
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,410
So we need appropriate bounds.

117
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,620
So where do we get
those bounds?

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,010
Well, we go back to the
question, and here, the

119
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,650
question had to have told us.

120
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:49,820
Right?

121
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,640
If the question didn't tell us,
then it didn't actually

122
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,070
describe a piece of curve, or
a finite piece of curve,

123
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,880
really, is the point.

124
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,890
So the question tells us
that we want this from

125
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,550
t equals 1 to 2.

126
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:13,420
So the arc length, we just
integrate our little element

127
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,240
of arc length over the
appropriate interval.

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,440
So that's t from 1 to 2 of the
square root of t to the fourth

129
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,220
plus 1 over t squared dt.

130
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,470
All right.

131
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,430
So as I said at the beginning,
this is not an integral that's

132
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,800
readily susceptible to the
techniques that we've learned.

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,030
You know, if you were
interested, you could try some

134
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,530
numerical methods on it.

135
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,580
I'm sure, you know, computer
algebra software can spit out,

136
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,040
at worse, a good numerical

137
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,840
approximation, if you're curious.

138
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,550
One more thing I want to say
about this question, is that

139
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,770
we did all this without ever
trying to draw the curve, or

140
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,630
think about what the
curve looks like.

141
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,800
So it's not that hard to get
some sort of basic sense of

142
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
the behavior of this curve.

143
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,780
For example, when t gets very,
very large, we see that what

144
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,515
happens is that x and y, well,
the 1 over t gets small, so x

145
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,050
and y get close to each other.

146
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,300
But x is just a tiny,
tiny bit bigger.

147
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,905
So for, as t gets very, very
big, you see that the point on

148
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:20,060
the curve is getting very close
to the line y equals x,

149
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,940
but not actually touching it.

150
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,480
And you can, you know, you can
try other things, as t gets

151
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,090
close to 0 from the positive
side, as t gets close to 0

152
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,360
from the negative side.

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,290
So this has some sort of
asymptote, it seems like.

154
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,670
There's some other things
you could check.

155
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,140
You could try to show that the
x value is always either--

156
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,320
well, when t is positive, it's
always at least 2, or when t

157
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,190
is negative, it's always at
least negative 2, and there's

158
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,120
a sort of gap in between.

159
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,780
You could analyze its
properties there.

160
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,790
The other thing you could do,
is you could try and solve

161
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,840
these equations to eliminate
t, and get just rectangular

162
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,580
equations in terms of x and y.

163
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,056
So I'm not going to
do that for you.

164
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,340
I'll give you a hint about
how I would go about it.

165
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,960
Which is, you could start
off-- so you want

166
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,350
to eliminate t.

167
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,230
So I think the nicest way to
do that is if you add these

168
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,640
two equations.

169
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,950
You'll get that the 1 over t's
cancel out, and you get 2t

170
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,840
equals x plus y, or t equals
x plus y over 2.

171
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,900
And then you can take, and you
could substitute it back into

172
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,650
one of these equations.

173
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,390
And when you substitute it
back, then you'll have an

174
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,950
equation that just involves x
and y, which, with a little

175
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,880
more simplification, takes a
form that you should already

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,060
be familiar with.

177
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,920
OK.

178
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,070
And yes.

179
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,410
Arc length.

180
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,810
This is how we do arc length
in parametric form.

181
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,210
Works out pretty nice, except
in this case, we get an

182
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,560
integral we can't evaluate
at the very end.

183
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,150
Too bad.

184
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,590
All right.

185
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,210
I'll leave it with that.

186
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:50,397
