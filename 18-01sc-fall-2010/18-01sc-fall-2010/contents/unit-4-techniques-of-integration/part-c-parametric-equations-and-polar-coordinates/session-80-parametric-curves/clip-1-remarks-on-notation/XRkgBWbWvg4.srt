8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,000
PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to continue our discussion

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,780
of parametric curves.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,960
I have to tell you
about arc length.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,590
And let me remind me where
we left off last time.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:45,820
This is parametric
curves, continued.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,380
Last time, we talked about
the parametric representation

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,730
for the circle.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,960
Or one of the parametric
representations for the circle.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,210
Which was this one here.

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,590
And first we noted that
this does parameterize,

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,770
as we say, the circle.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,390
That satisfies the
equation for the circle.

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:17,990
And it's traced
counterclockwise.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,590
The picture looks like this.

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,350
Here's the circle.

23
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,400
And it starts out here
at t = 0 and it gets up

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,820
to here at time t = pi / 2.

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:41,330
So now I have to talk
to you about arc length.

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,840
In this parametric form.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,170
And the results should
be the same as arc length

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,830
around this circle ordinarily.

29
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:55,840
And we start out with this
basic differential relationship.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,080
ds^2 is dx^2 + dy^2.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,880
And then I'm going to take
the square root, divide by dt,

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,540
so the rate of change
with respect to t of s

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,780
is going to be the square root.

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,220
Well, maybe I'll write
it without dividing.

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,130
Just write it as ds.

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:24,640
So this would be
(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2, dt.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,050
So this is what you get
formally from this equation.

38
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,920
If you take its
square roots and you

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,470
divide by dt squared
in the-- inside

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,510
the square root, and you
multiply by dt outside,

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,630
so that those cancel.

42
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,220
And this is the formal
connection between the two.

43
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,600
We'll be saying just
a few more words

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,430
in a few minutes about how to
make sense of that rigorously.

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,020
Alright so that's the set of
formulas for the infinitesimal,

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,110
the differential of arc length.

47
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,820
And so to figure it out, I have
to differentiate x with respect

48
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,810
to t.

49
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,225
And remember x is up here.

50
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:11,330
It's defined by a cos t, so
its derivative is -a sin t.

51
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:19,850
And similarly, dy/dt = a cos t.

52
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,000
And so I can plug this in.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,620
And I get the arc
length element,

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:36,920
which is the square root of
(-a sin t)^2 + (a cos t)^2, dt.

55
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,670
Which just becomes the square
root of a^2, dt, or a dt.

56
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,370
Now, I was about to divide by t.

57
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,630
Let me do that now.

58
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,050
We can also write the rate
of change of arc length

59
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,430
with respect to t.

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,640
And that's a, in this case.

61
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,420
And this gets
interpreted as the speed

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,180
of the particle going around.

63
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,270
So not only, let me
trade these two guys,

64
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:14,020
not only do we have the
direction is counterclockwise,

65
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,010
but we also have that the speed
is, if you like, it's uniform.

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,740
It's constant speed.

67
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,650
And the rate is a.

68
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,810
So that's ds/dt.

69
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,840
Travelling around.

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,310
And that means that we can
play around with the speed.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,650
And I just want to point out--
So the standard thing, what

72
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,430
you'll have to get
used to, and this

73
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,520
is a standard presentation,
you'll see this everywhere.

74
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,710
In your physics classes and
your other math classes,

75
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,230
if you want to change
the speed, so a new speed

76
00:04:51,230 --> 00:05:01,440
going around this would be, if
I set up the equations this way.

77
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,650
Now I'm tracing around
the same circle.

78
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,120
But the speed is
going to turn out

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,470
to be, if you figure
it out, there'll

80
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,200
be an extra factor of k.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,460
So it'll be ak.

82
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,540
That's what we'll work
out to be the speed.

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,290
Provided k is positive
and a is positive.

84
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:30,490
So we're making
these conventions.

85
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,180
The constants that we're
using are positive.

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,980
Now, that's the first
and most basic example.

87
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,730
The one that comes
up constantly.

88
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,120
Now, let me just make those
comments about notation

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,860
that I wanted to make.

90
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,884
And we've been treating these
squared differentials here

91
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,300
for a little while
and I just want

92
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,810
to pay attention
a little bit more

93
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,280
carefully to these
manipulations.

94
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,660
And what's allowed
and what's not.

95
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,890
And what's justified
and what's not.

96
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,680
So the basis for this was this
approximate calculation that we

97
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,440
had, that (delta s)^2 was
(delta x)^2 + (delta y)^2.

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,370
This is how we justified the
arc length formula before.

99
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,530
And let me just show you
that the formula that I

100
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,410
have up here, this
basic formula for arc

101
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,760
length in the
parametric form, follows

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,520
just as the other one did.

103
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,370
And now I'm going to do it
slightly more rigorously.

104
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,400
I do the division really
in disguise before I take

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,310
the limit of the infinitesimal.

106
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,349
So all I'm really doing
is I'm doing this.

107
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,390
Dividing through by this,
and sorry this is still

108
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,340
approximately equal.

109
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,760
So I'm not dividing by something
that's 0 or infinitesimal.

110
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,320
I'm dividing by
something nonzero.

111
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,120
And here I have ((delta
x)/(delta t))^2 + ((delta

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,560
y)/(delta t))^2 And
then in the limit,

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,170
I have ds/dt is equal to
the square root of this guy.

114
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:13,820
Or, if you like, the
square of it, so.

115
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,200
So it's legal to divide by
something that's almost 0

116
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,340
and then take the
limit as we go to 0.

117
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,280
This is really what
derivatives are all about.

118
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,850
That we get a limit here.

119
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,010
As the denominator goes to 0.

120
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,510
Because the numerator's
going to 0 too.

121
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,770
So that's the notation.

122
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,060
And now I want to warn you,
maybe just a little bit,

123
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,420
about misuses, if you
like, of the notation.

124
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,820
We don't do absolutely
everything this way.

125
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,280
This expression that
came up with the squares,

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,130
you should never
write it as this.

127
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:01,600
This, put it on the board
but very quickly, never.

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,420
OK.

129
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,130
Don't do that.

130
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,700
We use these square
differentials,

131
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,840
but we don't do it
with these ratios here.

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,900
But there was another place
which is slightly confusing.

133
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,680
It looks very
similar, where we did

134
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,247
use the square of the
differential in a denominator.

135
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,580
And I just want to point out
to you that it's different.

136
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,940
It's not the same.

137
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,810
And it is OK.

138
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,660
And that was this one.

139
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,970
This thing here.

140
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,900
This is a second derivative,
it's something else.

141
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,300
And it's got a dt^2
in the denominator.

142
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,230
So it looks rather similar.

143
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:49,230
But what this represents is
the quantity d/dt squared.

144
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,840
And you can see the
squares came in.

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,790
And squared the two expressions.

146
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,970
And then there's
also an x over here.

147
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,600
So that's legal.

148
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,550
Those are notations
that we do use.

149
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,070
And we can even calculate this.

150
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,650
It has a perfectly good meaning.

151
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,540
It's the same as the
derivative with respect

152
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,870
to t of the derivative of x,
which we already know was minus

153
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,530
sine-- sorry, a sin t, I guess.

154
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,120
Not this example,
but the previous one.

155
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,870
Up here.

156
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,340
So the derivative
is this and so I can

157
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,140
differentiate a second time.

158
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,850
And I get -a cos t.

159
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,760
So that's a perfectly
legal operation.

160
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,440
Everything in there makes sense.

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,880
Just don't use that.

162
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,770
There's another really
unfortunate thing,

163
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,820
right which is that the 2 creeps
in funny places with sines.

164
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,080
You have sine squared.

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,150
It would be out here,
it comes up here

166
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,810
for some strange reason.

167
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,730
This is just because
typographers are lazy

168
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,880
or somebody somewhere
in the history

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,620
of mathematical typography
decided to let the 2 migrate.

170
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,650
It would be like
putting the 2 over here.

171
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,940
There's inconsistency
in mathematics, right.

172
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,570
We're not perfect and people
just develop these notations.

173
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,450
So we have to live with them.

174
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,210
The ones that people
accept as conventions.

175
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,230
The next example that
I want to give you

176
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,920
is just slightly different.

177
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,140
It'll be a non-constant
speed parameterization.

178
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,470
Here x = 2 sin t.

179
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,590
And y is, say, cos t.

180
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,450
And let's keep track
of what this one does.

181
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,605
Now, this is a skill
which I'm going

182
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,170
to ask you about quite a bit.

183
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,690
And it's one of several skills.

184
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,970
You'll have to connect
this with some kind

185
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,330
of rectangular equation.

186
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,725
An equation for x and y.

187
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:54,230
And we'll be doing a certain
amount of this today.

188
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,240
In another context.

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,510
Right here, to see the pattern,
we know that the relationship

190
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,160
we're going to want to use
is that sin^2 + cos^2 = 1.

191
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,910
So in fact the right thing to do
here is to take 1/4 x^2 + y^2.

192
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,020
And that's going to turn
out to be sin^2 t + cos^2 t.

193
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,310
Which is 1.

194
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,500
So there's the equation.

195
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,690
Here's the rectangular equation
for this parametric curve.

196
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,030
And this describes an ellipse.

197
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,570
That's not the only information
that we can get here.

198
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,180
The other information
that we can get

199
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,570
is this qualitative
information of where

200
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,360
we start, where we're
going, the direction.

201
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,540
It starts out, I
claim, at t = 0.

202
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:54,630
That's when t = 0, this is
(2 sin 0, cos 0), right?

203
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,330
(2 sin 0, cos 0) is equal
to the point (0, 1).

204
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,360
So it starts up up here.

205
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,140
At (0, 1).

206
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,520
And then the next little
place, so this is one thing

207
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,400
that certainly you
want to do. t = pi/2

208
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,510
is maybe the next
easy point to plot.

209
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:22,830
And that's going to be
(2 sin(pi/2), cos(pi/2)).

210
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,880
And that's just (2, 0).

211
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,490
And so that's over
here somewhere.

212
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,422
This is (2, 0).

213
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:36,130
And we know it travels
along the ellipse.

214
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,120
And we know the minor axis is
1, and the major axis is 2,

215
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,000
so it's doing this.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,090
So this is what
happens at t = 0.

217
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,390
This is where we
are at t = pi/2.

218
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,510
And it continues all
the way around, etc.

219
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,370
To the rest of the ellipse.

220
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,750
This is the direction.

221
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:09,620
So this one happens
to be clockwise.

222
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,640
Alright, now let's keep
track of its speed.

223
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:25,610
Let's keep track of the speed,
and also the arc length.

224
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,830
So the speed is the square
root of the derivatives here.

225
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,580
That would be (2 cos
t)^2 + (sin t)^2.

226
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,060
And the arc length is what?

227
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,840
Well, if we want to
go all the way around,

228
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,540
we need to know that that
takes a total of 2 pi.

229
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,990
So 0 to 2 pi.

230
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,310
And then we have to integrate
ds, which is this expression,

231
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,620
or ds/dt, dt.

232
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:11,630
So that's the square root
of 4 cos^2 t + sin^2 t, dt.

233
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,580
The bad news, if you
like, is that this is not

234
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:38,524
an elementary integral.

235
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:39,940
In other words,
no matter how long

236
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,240
you try to figure out
how to antidifferentiate

237
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,180
this expression, no matter how
many substitutions you try,

238
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,420
you will fail.

239
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,030
That's the bad news.

240
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:58,430
The good news is this is
not an elementary integral.

241
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,810
It's not an elementary integral.

242
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,330
Which means that this is
the answer to a question.

243
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,230
Not something that
you have to work on.

244
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,680
So if somebody asks you for
this arc length, you stop here.

245
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,550
That's the answer, so it's
actually better than it looks.

246
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,700
And we'll try to--
I mean, I don't

247
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,230
expect you to know already
what all of the integrals

248
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,680
are that are impossible.

249
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
And which ones are hard
and which ones are easy.

250
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,200
So we'll try to coach
you through when

251
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,390
you face these things.

252
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,670
It's not so easy to decide.

253
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,345
I'll give you a few clues, but.

254
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:34,845
OK.

255
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:38,310
So this is the arc length.

256
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,270
Now, I want to move on to
the last thing that we did.

257
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,410
Last type of thing
that we did last time.

258
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:54,140
Which is the surface area.

259
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,230
And yeah, question.

260
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:03,609
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

261
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,650
PROFESSOR: The question,
this is a good question.

262
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,290
The question is, when
you draw the ellipse,

263
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,650
do you not take into
account what t is.

264
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,460
The answer is that
this is in disguise.

265
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,360
What's going on here
is we have a trouble

266
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,720
with plotting in the plane
what's really happening.

267
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,210
So in other words, it's
kind of in trouble.

268
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,940
So the point is that we have
two functions of t, not one.

269
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,660
x(t) and y(t).

270
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,970
So one thing that I can do if
I plot things in the plane.

271
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,710
In other words, the
main point to make here

272
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,150
is that we're not talking
about the situation

273
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,480
y is a function of x.

274
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,870
We're out of that realm now.

275
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,620
We're somewhere in
a different part

276
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,450
of the universe in our thought.

277
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,760
And you should drop
this point of view.

278
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,990
So this depiction is not
y as a function of x.

279
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,940
Well, that's obvious because
there are two values here,

280
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,710
as opposed to one.

281
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,960
So we're in trouble with that.

282
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,750
And we have that
background parameter,

283
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,170
and that's exactly
why we're using it.

284
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,230
This parameter t.

285
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,430
So that we can depict
the entire curve.

286
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,200
And deal with it as one thing.

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,590
So since I can't really draw
it, and since t is nowhere

288
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,840
on the map, you should
sort of imagine it as time,

289
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,760
and there's some kind of
trajectory which is travelling

290
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,260
around.

291
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,590
And then I just labelled
a couple of the places.

292
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,370
If somebody asked you to
draw a picture of this,

293
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,230
well, I'll tell you exactly
where you need the picture

294
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,250
in just one second, alright.

295
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,690
It's going to come up
right now in surface area.

296
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,450
But otherwise, if
nobody asks you to,

297
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,020
you don't even have to put
down t = 0 and t = pi / 2 here.

298
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,402
Because nobody
demanded it of you.

299
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:47,110
Another question.

300
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,842
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

301
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,550
PROFESSOR: So, another
very good question

302
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,890
which is exactly
connected to this picture.

303
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,060
So how is it that we're
going to use the picture,

304
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,190
and how is it we're going
to use the notion of the t.

305
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,040
The question was, why is
this from t = 0 to t = 2 pi?

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,000
That does use the t
information on this diagram.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,150
the point is, we do
know that t starts here.

308
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,620
This is pi / 2, this is pi, this
is 3 pi / 2, and this is 2 pi.

309
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,380
When you go all the
way around once,

310
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,240
it's going to come
back to itself.

311
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,720
These are periodic
functions of period 2 pi.

312
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,780
And they come back to
themselves exactly at 2 pi.

313
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,030
And so that's why we know
in order to get around once,

314
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,250
we need to go from 0 to 2 pi.

315
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,640
And the same thing is going
to come up with surface area

316
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,370
right now.

317
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,720
That's going to be the
issue, is what range of t

318
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,620
we're going to need when we
compute the surface area.

319
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,144
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

320
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,185
PROFESSOR: In a question,
what you might be asked

321
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:56,180
is what's the
rectangular equation

322
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,650
for a parametric curve?

323
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,720
So that would be
1/4 x^2 + y^2 = 1.

324
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,430
And then you might
be asked, plot it.

325
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,960
Well, that would be a
picture of the ellipse.

326
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,380
OK, those are types of questions
that are legal questions.

327
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:27,439
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

328
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,980
PROFESSOR: The
question is, do I need

329
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,600
to know any specific formulas?

330
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,250
Any formulas that you know
and remember will help you.

331
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,400
They may be of limited use.

332
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,640
I'm not going to ask
you to memorize anything

333
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,820
except, I guarantee you that
the circle is going to come up.

334
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,500
Not the ellipse, the circle
will come up everywhere

335
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,320
in your life.

336
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,710
So at least at MIT,
your life at MIT.

337
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,002
We're very round here.

338
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:52,960
Yeah, another question.

339
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,811
STUDENT: I'm just a tiny bit
confused back to the basics.

340
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:58,810
This is more a question
from yesterday, I guess.

341
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:04,390
But when you have your
original ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2,

342
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:10,060
and then you integrate that to
get arc length, how are you,

343
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,360
the integral has dx's and dy's.

344
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,590
So how are you just
integrating with respect to dx?

345
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,560
PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is how are we just integrating

346
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,200
with respect to x?

347
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,880
So this is a question which
goes back to last time.

348
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
And what is it with arc length.

349
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,370
So.

350
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,442
I'm going to have to answer
that question in connection

351
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,400
with what we did today.

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,420
So this is a subtle question.

353
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,450
But I want you to realize
that this is actually

354
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,290
an important
conceptual step here.

355
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,810
So shhh, everybody, listen.

356
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,340
If you're representing
one-dimensional objects,

357
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,050
which are curves,
maybe, in space.

358
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,270
Or in two dimensions.

359
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,759
When you're keeping
track of arc length,

360
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,800
you're going to have to
have an integral which is

361
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,180
with respect to some variable.

362
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,510
But that variable,
you get to pick.

363
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,310
And we're launching now
into this variety of choices

364
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,950
of variables with
respect to which you

365
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,980
can represent something.

366
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,580
Now, there are
some disadvantages

367
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,370
on the circle to
representing things

368
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,480
with respect to the variable x.

369
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,732
Because there are two
points on the circle here.

370
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:26,190
On the other hand,
you actually can

371
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,480
succeed with half the circle.

372
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,620
So you can figure out
the arc length that way.

373
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,521
And then you can set it
up as an integral dx.

374
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,770
But you can also set it up
as an integral with respect

375
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,240
to any parameter you want.

376
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,170
And the uniform parameter
is perhaps the easiest one.

377
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,210
This one is perhaps
the easiest one.

378
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,970
And so now the thing that's
strange about this perspective

379
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,470
- and I'm going to make this
point later in the lecture

380
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,810
as well - is that the
letters x and y-- As I say,

381
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,630
you should drop this notion
that y is a function of x.

382
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,950
This is what we're throwing
away at this point.

383
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,770
What we're thinking
of is, you can

384
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,110
describe things in terms
of any coordinate you want.

385
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,340
You just have to say what each
one is in terms of the others.

386
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,300
And these x and y
over here are where

387
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,380
we are in the Cartesian
coordinate system.

388
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,490
They're not-- And
in this case they're

389
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,610
functions of some
other variable.

390
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,720
Some other variable.

391
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,150
So they're each functions.

392
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,480
So the letters x and
y just changed on you.

393
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,710
They mean something different.
x is no longer the variable.

394
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,810
It's the function.

395
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,542
Right?

396
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,250
You're going to have
to get used to that.

397
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,380
That's because we
run out of letters.

398
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,870
And we kind of want to use
all of them the way we want.

399
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,290
I'll say some more
about that later.

400
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,220
So now I want to do this
surface area example.

401
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:59,150
I'm going to just take the
surface area of the ellipsoid.

402
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:11,340
The surface of the
ellipsoid formed

403
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:19,910
by revolving this previous
example, which was Example 2.

404
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:28,020
Around the y-axis.

405
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,410
So we want to set up that
surface area integral here

406
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,490
for you.

407
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:38,160
Now, I remind you that the
area element looks like this.

408
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,190
If you're revolving
around the y-axis,

409
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,815
that means you're
going around this way

410
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:43,720
and you have some curve.

411
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,990
In this case it's this
piece of an ellipse.

412
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,475
If you sweep it
around you're going

413
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,770
to get what's
called an ellipsoid.

414
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,890
And there's a little chunk here,
that you're wrapping around.

415
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,430
And the important thing you
need besides this ds, this arc

416
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,120
length piece over here, is
the distance to the axis.

417
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,320
So that's this
horizontal distance here.

418
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,850
I'll draw it in another color.

419
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:15,520
And that horizontal
distance now has a name.

420
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,670
And this is, again, the virtue
of this coordinate system.

421
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,170
The t is something else.

422
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,020
This has a name.

423
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,760
This distance has a name.

424
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,080
This distance is called x.

425
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,570
And it even has a formula.

426
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:36,090
Its formula is 2 sin t.

427
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,550
In terms of t.

428
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,530
So the full formula
up for the integral

429
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,039
here is, I have to take
the circumference when

430
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,080
I spin this thing around.

431
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,950
And this little
arc length element.

432
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,660
So I have here 2
pi times 2 sin t.

433
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,640
That's the x variable here.

434
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,560
And then I have here ds,
which is kind of a mess.

435
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,170
So unfortunately I don't
quite have room for it.

436
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,650
Plan ahead.

437
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:15,200
Square root of 4 cos^2 t + sin^2
t, is that what it was, dt.

438
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,740
Alright, I guess I
squeezed it in there.

439
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,090
So that was the arc
length, which I re-copied

440
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,620
from this board above.

441
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,310
That was the ds piece.

442
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:29,760
It's this whole thing
including the dt.

443
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,360
That's the answer
except for one thing.

444
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,590
What else do we need?

445
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,350
We don't just need
the integrand,

446
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,720
this is half of
setting up an integral.

447
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,990
The other half of setting up
an integral is the limits.

448
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,840
We need specific limits here.

449
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,760
Otherwise we don't have a
number that we can get out.

450
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,370
So we now have to think
about what the limits are.

451
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,550
And maybe somebody can see.

452
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,429
It has something to
do with this diagram

453
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,470
of the ellipse over here.

454
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,520
Can somebody guess what it is?

455
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,480
0 to pi.

456
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,070
Well, that was quick.

457
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,620
That's it.

458
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,709
Because we go from
the top to the bottom,

459
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,250
but we don't want
to continue around.

460
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,640
We don't want to
go from 0 to 2 pi,

461
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,723
because that would be
duplicating what we're going

462
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:12,020
to get when we spin around.

463
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,730
And we know that we start at 0.

464
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,540
It's interesting
because it descends

465
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,090
when you change
variables to think

466
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,360
of it in terms of the y variable
it's going the opposite way.

467
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,550
But anyway, just one piece
of this is what we want.

468
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,660
So that's this setup.

469
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:36,230
And now I claim that this is
actually a doable integral.

470
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,850
However, it's long.

471
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,830
I'm going to spare
you, I'll just tell you

472
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,330
how you would get started.

473
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,970
You would use the
substitution u = cos t.

474
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:53,620
And then the du is
going to be -sin t dt.

475
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,290
But then, unfortunately,
there's a lot more.

476
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,810
There's another
trig substitution

477
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,430
with some other multiple
of the cosine and so forth.

478
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,420
So it goes on and on.

479
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,260
If you want to check
it yourself, you can.

480
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,710
There's an inverse
trig substitution which

481
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,590
isn't compatible with this one.

482
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,090
But it can be done.

483
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,690
Calculated.

484
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,980
In elementary terms.

485
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,547
Yeah, another question.

486
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:31,380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

487
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,490
PROFESSOR: So, if you
get this on an exam,

488
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,240
I'm going to have to
coach you through it.

489
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,640
Either I'm going to have to
tell you don't evaluate it

490
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,130
or, you're going to have
to work really hard.

491
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,500
Or here's the first step,
and then the next step

492
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,299
is, keep on going.

493
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:44,840
Or something.

494
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,890
I'll have to give you some cues.

495
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,260
Because it's quite long.

496
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,860
This is way too long for an
exam, this particular one.

497
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,650
OK.

498
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,359
It's not too long
for a problem set.

499
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,650
This is where I would leave
you off if I were giving it

500
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,320
to you on a problem set.

501
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,220
Just to give you an idea
of the order of magnitude.

502
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,761
Whereas one of the ones that I
did yesterday, I wouldn't even

503
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:11,120
give you on a problem
set, it was so long.

504
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,630
So now, our next job is to
move on to polar coordinates.

505
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,960
Now, polar coordinates involve
the geometry of circles.

506
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,392
As I said, we really
love circles here.

507
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:24,100
We're very round.

508
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,210
Just as I love 0, the rest of
the Institute loves circles.

509
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:47,380
So we're going to
do that right now.

510
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:58,900
What we're going to talk about
now is polar coordinates.

511
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,010
Which are set up in
the following way.

512
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,640
It's a way of describing
the points in the plane.

513
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,460
Here is a point in
a plane, and here's

514
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,530
what we think of as
the usual x-y axes.

515
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,860
And now this point is
going to be described

516
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,260
by a different pair of
coordinates, different pair

517
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,190
of numbers.

518
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:26,420
Namely, the distance
to the origin.

519
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,490
And the second parameter
here, second number here,

520
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,550
is this angle theta.

521
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:41,500
Which is the angle
of ray from origin

522
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:48,670
with the horizontal axis.

523
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,620
So that's what it
is in language.

524
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,690
And you should put this
in quotation marks,

525
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,320
because it's not
a perfect match.

526
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,800
This is geometrically what
you should always think of,

527
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,720
but the technical
details involve

528
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,530
dealing directly with formulas.

529
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,880
The first formula is
the formula for x.

530
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,590
And this is the
fundamental, these two

531
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,750
are the fundamental ones.

532
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,120
Namely, x = r cos theta.

533
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,860
The second formula
is the formula

534
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,380
for y, which is r sin theta.

535
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,420
So these are the
unambiguous definitions

536
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,100
of polar coordinates.

537
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,790
This is it.

538
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,590
And this is the thing from
which all other almost correct

539
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:37,180
statements almost follow.

540
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,320
But this is the one you
should trust always.

541
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,980
This is the
unambiguous statement.

542
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,360
So let me give you an
example something that's

543
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,040
close to being a good
formula and is certainly

544
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,530
useful in its way.

545
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:04,180
Namely, you can think of r as
being the square root of x^2 +

546
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,810
y^2.

547
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,336
That's easy enough
to derive, it's

548
00:31:07,336 --> 00:31:08,460
the distance to the origin.

549
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,320
That's pretty obvious.

550
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,690
And the formula for theta,
which you can also derive,

551
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,480
which is that it's the
inverse tangent of y y/x.

552
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,310
However, let me just warn
you that these formulas are

553
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,870
slightly ambiguous.

554
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:33,357
So somewhat ambiguous.

555
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:35,440
In other words, you can't
just apply them blindly.

556
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,023
You actually have
to look at a picture

557
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:38,180
in order to get them right.

558
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,690
In particular, r could
be plus or minus here.

559
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,950
And when you take
the inverse tangent,

560
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,510
there's an ambiguity between,
it's the same as the inverse

561
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,330
tangent of (-y)/(-x).

562
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,550
So these minus signs are a
plague on your existence.

563
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,050
And you're not going to get a
completely unambiguous answer

564
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,760
out of these formulas
without paying attention

565
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,430
to the diagram.

566
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,550
On the other hand, the
formula up in the box

567
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,337
there always works.

568
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:15,920
So when people mean
polar coordinates,

569
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,370
they always mean that.

570
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,370
And then they have conventions,
which sometimes match things up

571
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,550
with the formulas over
on this next board.

572
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:32,670
Let me give you various
examples here first.

573
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,260
But maybe first I
should I should draw

574
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,100
the two coordinate systems.

575
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,560
So the coordinate system
that we're used to

576
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,360
is the rectangular
coordinate system.

577
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,190
And maybe I'll draw it
in orange and green here.

578
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:59,430
So these are the coordinate
lines y = 0, y = 1, y = 2.

579
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,950
That's how the
coordinate system works.

580
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:08,427
And over here we have the
rest of the coordinate system.

581
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:10,510
And this is the way we're
thinking of x and y now.

582
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,570
We're no longer thinking of
y as a function of x and x

583
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,986
as a function of
y, we're thinking

584
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:16,960
of x as a label of
a place in a plane.

585
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,900
And y as a label of
a place in a plane.

586
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:27,770
So here we have x =
0, x = 1, x = 2, etc.

587
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,740
Here's x = -1.

588
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,900
So forth.

589
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,100
So that's what the rectangular
coordinate system looks like.

590
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,380
And now I should draw the other
coordinate system that we have.

591
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,900
Which is this guy here.

592
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,610
Well, close enough.

593
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,720
And these guys here.

594
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,730
Kind of this bulls-eye
or target operation.

595
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,480
And this one is,
say, theta = pi/2.

596
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,870
This is theta = 0.

597
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,710
This is theta = -pi/4.

598
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,380
For instance, so I've
just labeled for you three

599
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,870
of the rays on this diagram.

600
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:23,130
It's kind of like
a radar screen.

601
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,840
And then in pink, this is
maybe r = 2, the radius 2.

602
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,980
And inside is r = 1.

603
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,090
So it's a different coordinate
system for the plane.

604
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,120
And again, the letter
r represents measuring

605
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,930
how far we are from the origin.

606
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,060
The theta represents
something about the angle,

607
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,250
which ray we're on.

608
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,260
And they're just two
different variables.

609
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:10,880
And this is a very different
kind of coordinate system.

610
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,391
OK so, our main job is
just to get used to this.

611
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:15,890
For now.

612
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,350
You will be using
this a lot in 18.02.

613
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,570
It's very useful in physics.

614
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,680
And our job is just to
get started with it.

615
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,990
And so, let's try a
few examples here.

616
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,220
Tons of examples.

617
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,590
We'll start out very slow.

618
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:41,860
If you have (x, y) = (1, -1),
that's a point in the plane.

619
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,380
I can draw that point.

620
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,460
It's down here, right?

621
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,630
This is -1 and this is 1,
and here's my point, (1, -1).

622
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,550
I can figure out what
the representative is

623
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,670
of this in polar coordinates.

624
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:03,040
So in polar coordinates,
there are actually

625
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,130
a bunch of choices here.

626
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,250
First of all, I'll
tell you one choice.

627
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,970
If I start with the
angle horizontally,

628
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,200
I wrap all the way
around, that would

629
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,350
be to this ray here--
Let's do it in green again.

630
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,820
Alright, I labeled
it actually as -pi/4,

631
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:27,310
but another way of looking at
it is that it's this angle here.

632
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,440
So that would be r
= square root of 2.

633
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,210
Theta = 7pi/4.

634
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,750
So that's one possibility of
the angle and the distance.

635
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,380
I know the distance is a square
root of 2, that's not hard.

636
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,930
Another way of looking
at it is the way

637
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,640
which was suggested
when I labeled this

638
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,230
with a negative angle.

639
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:56,850
And that would be r = square
root of 2, theta = -pi/4.

640
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,370
And these are both legal.

641
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,736
These are perfectly
legal representatives.

642
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:02,110
And that's what
I meant by saying

643
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,180
that these representations over
here are somewhat ambiguous.

644
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,900
There's more than one answer
to this question, of what

645
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,860
the polar representation is.

646
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:17,190
A third possibility, which is
even more dicey but also legal,

647
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,890
is r equals minus
square root of 2.

648
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,360
Theta = 3pi/4.

649
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,080
Now, what that corresponds to
doing is going around to here.

650
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,490
We're pointing out
3/4 pi direction.

651
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,130
But then going negative
square root of 2 distance.

652
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,710
We're going backwards.

653
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,250
So we're landing
in the same place.

654
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,380
So this is also legal.

655
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,880
Yeah.

656
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,324
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

657
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:53,240
PROFESSOR: The question
is, don't the radiuses

658
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,989
have to be positive
because they represent

659
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:56,620
a distance to the origin?

660
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,620
The answer is I
lied to you here.

661
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,770
All of these things that I said
are wrong, except for this.

662
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,020
Which is the rule for what
polar coordinates mean.

663
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:21,170
So it's maybe plus or minus the
distance, is what it is always.

664
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:29,090
I try not to lie to you
too much, but I do succeed.

665
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:36,270
Now, let's do a little
bit more practice here.

666
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,330
There are some easy
examples, which

667
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,580
I will run through
very quickly. r = a,

668
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,100
we already know
this is a circle.

669
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:51,280
And the 3 theta equals
a constant is a ray.

670
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,820
However, this involves an
implicit assumption, which

671
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,360
I want to point out to you.

672
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,040
So this is Example 3.

673
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,060
Theta's equal to a
constant is a ray.

674
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:14,070
But this implicitly
assumes 0 <= r < infinity.

675
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:19,400
If you really wanted to allow
minus infinity < r < infinity

676
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,890
in this example, you
would get a line.

677
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:28,540
Gives the whole line.

678
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,050
It gives everything behind.

679
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,085
So you go out on some ray,
you go backwards on that ray

680
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,460
and you get the whole line
through the origin, both ways.

681
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,740
If you allow r going to
minus infinity as well.

682
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,310
So the typical
conventions, so here

683
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:49,680
are the typical conventions.

684
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,140
And you will see people assume
this without even telling you.

685
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,340
So you need to watch out for it.

686
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,450
The typical conventions
are certainly this one,

687
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,270
which is a nice thing to do.

688
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,240
Pretty much all the time,
although not all the time.

689
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,360
Most of the time.

690
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,950
And then you might have
theta ranging from minus pi

691
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,730
to pi, so in other words
symmetric around 0.

692
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:21,630
Or, another very popular
choice is this one.

693
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,890
Theta's >= 0 and
strictly less than 2pi.

694
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,660
So these are the
two typical ranges

695
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,930
in which all of these
variables are chosen.

696
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,900
But not always.

697
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:43,210
You'll find that
it's not consistent.

698
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,010
As I said, our job is
to get used to this.

699
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,600
And I need to work up
to some slightly more

700
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,420
complicated examples.

701
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,840
Some of which I'll give
you on next Tuesday.

702
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:05,780
But let's do a few more.

703
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,820
So, I guess this is Example 4.

704
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,980
Example 4, I'm
going to take y = 1.

705
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,650
That's awfully simple in
rectangular coordinates.

706
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,960
But interestingly,
you might conceivably

707
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,050
want to deal with it
in polar coordinates.

708
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,580
If you do, so here's how
you make the translation.

709
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,850
But this translation
is not so terrible.

710
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:39,080
What you do is, you plug
in y = r sin(theta).

711
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,710
That's all you have to do.

712
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,760
And so that's going
to be equal to 1.

713
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,240
And that's going to give
us our polar equation.

714
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,330
The polar equation is
r = 1 / sin(theta).

715
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,360
There it is.

716
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,120
And let's draw a picture of it.

717
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,480
So here's a picture
of the line y = 1.

718
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:11,950
And now we see that if we take
our rays going out from here,

719
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,240
they collide with the
line at various lengths.

720
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,760
So if you take an angle,
theta, here there'll

721
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,364
be a distance r
corresponding to that

722
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:23,030
and you'll hit this
in exactly one spot.

723
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,600
For each theta you'll
have a different radius.

724
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,810
And it's a variable radius.

725
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,740
It's given by this formula here.

726
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,210
And so to trace this
line out, you actually

727
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,120
have to realize that there's
one more thing involved.

728
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,160
Which is the possible
range of theta.

729
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,730
Again, when you're
doing integrations

730
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,104
you're going to need to know
those limits of integration.

731
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:46,360
So you're going to
need to know this.

732
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,990
The range here goes
from theta = 0,

733
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,230
that's sort of when
it's out at infinity.

734
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,140
That's when the
denominator is 0 here.

735
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,800
And it goes all the way to pi.

736
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,940
Swing around just one half-turn.

737
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,610
So the range here
is 0 < theta < pi.

738
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,620
Yeah, question.

739
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,676
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

740
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:11,050
PROFESSOR: The
question is, is it

741
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,940
typical to express r
as a function of theta,

742
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,550
or vice versa, or
does it matter?

743
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,790
The answer is that for the
purposes of this course,

744
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,420
we're almost always going to
be writing things in this form.

745
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,070
r as a function of theta.

746
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,050
And you can do
whatever you want.

747
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,920
This turns out to be what
we'll be doing in this course,

748
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,040
exclusively.

749
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,570
As you'll see when we
get to other examples,

750
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,160
it's the traditional
sort of thing

751
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,060
to do when you're thinking
about observing a planet

752
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,650
or something like that.

753
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,930
You see the angle, and then
you guess far away it is.

754
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,600
But it's not necessary.

755
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,940
The formulas are
often easier this way.

756
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,370
For the examples that we have.

757
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,610
Because it's usually a
trig function of theta.

758
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,110
Whereas the other way, it would
be an inverse trig function.

759
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,930
So it's an uglier expression.

760
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,540
As you can see.

761
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,860
The real reason is that we
choose this thing that's

762
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:19,410
easier to deal with.

763
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:22,200
So now let me give you a
slightly more complicated

764
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,410
example of the same type.

765
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,930
Where we use a shortcut.

766
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,680
This is a standard example.

767
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,960
And it comes up a lot.

768
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,730
And so this is an
off-center circle.

769
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:44,000
A circle is really easy
to describe, but not

770
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,170
necessarily if the center
is on the rim of the circle.

771
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,550
So that's a different problem.

772
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,990
And let's do this with
a circle of radius a.

773
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:06,120
So this is the point (a,
0) and this is (2a, 0).

774
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,550
And actually, if you
know these two numbers,

775
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,080
you'll be able to remember the
result of this calculation.

776
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,780
Which you'll do about five
or six times and then finally

777
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,310
you'll memorize it during 18.02
when you will need it a lot.

778
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,220
So this is a standard
calculation here.

779
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,350
So the starting place is
the rectangular equation.

780
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,170
And we're going to pass to
the polar representation.

781
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:33,550
The rectangular representation
is (x-a)^2 + y^2 = a^2.

782
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:40,290
So this is a circle centered
at (a, 0) of radius a.

783
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,110
And now, if you like, the
slow way of doing this

784
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:50,145
would be to plug in x = r
cos(theta), y = r sin(theta).

785
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:51,520
The way I did in
this first step.

786
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,500
And that works perfectly well.

787
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,980
But I'm going to do it
more quickly than that.

788
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,070
Because I can sort of see in
advance how it's going to work.

789
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:09,810
I'm just going to
expand this out.

790
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,160
And now I see the a^2's cancel.

791
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,120
And not only that,
but x^2 + y^2 = r^2.

792
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,670
So this becomes r^2.

793
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:28,590
That's x^2 + y^2 - 2ax = 0.

794
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,360
The r came from the fact
that r^2 = x^2 + y^2.

795
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,890
So I'm doing this the rapid way.

796
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,260
You can do it by
plugging in, as I said.

797
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,900
r equals-- So now that
I've simplified it,

798
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,720
I am going to use
that procedure.

799
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,570
I'm going to plug in.

800
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:57,120
So here I have r^2 -
2ar cos(theta) = 0.

801
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,146
I just plugged in for x.

802
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:02,270
As I said, I could have
done that at the beginning.

803
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,430
I just simplified first.

804
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:11,780
And now, this is the same
thing as r^2 = 2ar cos(theta).

805
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,530
And we're almost done.

806
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:19,230
There's a boring part of this
equation, which is r = 0.

807
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,530
And then there's,
if I divide by r,

808
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,430
there's the interesting
part of the equation.

809
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,830
Which is this.

810
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,810
So this is or r = 0.

811
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:33,690
Which is already included
in that equation anyway.

812
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,890
So I'm allowed to divide by r
because in the case of r = 0,

813
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,781
this is represented anyway.

814
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:40,280
Question.

815
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

816
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,270
PROFESSOR: r = 0
is just one case.

817
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,380
That is, it's the
union of these two.

818
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,550
It's both.

819
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,670
Both are possible.

820
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,270
So r = 0 is one point on it.

821
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,150
And this is all of it.

822
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:01,230
So we can just ignore this.

823
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,500
So now I want to say one
more important thing.

824
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,600
You need to understand
the range of this.

825
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,840
So wait a second and we're going
to figure out the range here.

826
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,710
The range is very important,
because otherwise you'll

827
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,280
never be able to integrate
using this representation here.

828
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,840
So this is the representation.

829
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,190
But notice when theta =
0, we're out here at 2a.

830
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,780
That's consistent,
and that's actually

831
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,020
how you remember
this factor 2a here.

832
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,570
Because if you remember this
picture and where you land when

833
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,830
theta = 0.

834
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,370
So that's the theta = 0 part.

835
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,440
But now as I tip
up like this, you

836
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,780
see that when we get to
vertical, we're done.

837
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,630
With the circle.

838
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,463
It's gotten shorter and
shorter and shorter,

839
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:49,020
and at theta = pi/2,
we're down at 0.

840
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,720
Because that's cos(pi/2) = 0.

841
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,770
So it swings up like this.

842
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,400
And it gets up to pi/2.

843
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,110
Similarly, we swing
down like this.

844
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,000
And then we're done.

845
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,510
So the range is
-pi/2 < theta < pi/2.

846
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,650
Or, if you want to
throw in the r = 0 case,

847
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,700
you can throw in this,
this is repeating,

848
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,200
if you like, at the ends.

849
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,100
So this is the range
of this circle.

850
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,150
