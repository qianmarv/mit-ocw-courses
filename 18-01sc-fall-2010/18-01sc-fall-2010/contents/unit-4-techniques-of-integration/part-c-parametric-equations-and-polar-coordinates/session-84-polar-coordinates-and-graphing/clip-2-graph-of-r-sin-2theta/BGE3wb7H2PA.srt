8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,020
PROFESSOR: So
again, welcome back.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,190
And today's topic
is a continuation

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,420
of what we did last time.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,850
We still have a little
bit of work and thinking

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:38,600
to do concerning
polar coordinates.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:50,210
So we're going to talk
about polar coordinates.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:58,320
And my first job today is to
talk a little bit about area.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
That's something we
didn't mention last time.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,320
And since we're all
back from Thanksgiving,

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,130
we can certainly talk
about it in terms of a pie.

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,650
Which is the basic idea for
area in polar coordinates.

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:21,840
Here's our pie, and
here's a slice of the pie.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,700
The slice has a piece of
arc length on it, which

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,150
I'm going to call delta theta.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,540
And the area of that
shaded-in slice,

23
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,070
I'm going to call delta A.

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,210
And let's suppose
that the radius is a.

25
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,350
Little a.

26
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,950
So this is a pie of radius a.

27
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,130
That's our picture.

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,510
Now, it's pretty easy
to figure out what

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,390
the area that slice of pie is.

30
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,650
The total area is,
of course, pi a^2.

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,030
We know that.

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,190
And to get this fraction,
delta A, all we have to do

33
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,270
is take the percentage of the
arc of the total circumference.

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:16,720
That's (delta theta) / This is
the fraction of area-- sorry,

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,590
fraction of the
total circumference,

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,900
the total length around the rim.

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,150
And then we multiply
that by pi a^2.

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,000
And that's giving
us the total area.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,500
And if you work that out,
that's delta A is equal

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,860
to, the pi's cancel and we
have 1/2 a^2 delta theta.

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:44,990
So here's the basic formula.

42
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:54,510
And now what we need to do is to
talk about a variable pie here.

43
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,790
That would be a pie with
a kind of a wavy crust.

44
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,520
Which is coming
around like this.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,140
So r = r(theta).

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,860
The distance from
the center is varying

47
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,420
with the place where we are, the
angle where we're shooting out.

48
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:22,070
And now I want to subdivide
that into little chunks here.

49
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,760
Now, the idea for adding
up the area, the total area

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,110
of this piece
that's swept out, is

51
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,160
to break it up into
little slices whose areas

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,580
are almost easy to calculate.

53
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,900
Namely, what we're
going to do is to take,

54
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,000
and I'm going to
label it this way.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm going to take these little
circular arcs, which go--

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,770
So I'm going to extend
past where this goes.

57
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,620
And then I'm going to take
each circular arc here.

58
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,510
So here's a circular arc.

59
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,010
And then here's
another circular arc.

60
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,590
And here's another circular arc.

61
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,250
It's just right on
the nose in that case.

62
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,050
Now, in these two
cases, so basically

63
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,910
the picture that I'm trying
to draw for you is this.

64
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,960
I have some sector.

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,445
And then I have
some circular arc.

66
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:23,400
And maybe it takes
a little extra.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,780
There's a little extra area,
I'm making an error in the area.

68
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,400
This is a little extra area.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,410
And maybe to draw
it the other way.

70
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,530
I'm a little short on this one.

71
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,190
And let's say on this one
I'm right on the nose.

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,950
I have the same arc as
the curve of the surface.

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,580
Now this is a little bit
like the step functions

74
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,240
that we used in Riemann sums.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,940
It's practically the same.

76
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,490
Eventually, this little band
of stuff that we're missing by,

77
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,110
if we take very, very
narrow little slices here,

78
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,610
is going to be negligible.

79
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,360
It'll get closer and
closer to the curve itself.

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,290
So that area will tend
to 0 in the limit.

81
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,940
So we don't have
to worry about it.

82
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,970
And the approximate
relationship is sitting here.

83
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,110
Where this distance now is r.

84
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,340
So this radius is r.

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,330
And this is this delta theta.

86
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,080
And so in the approximate case,
what we have is that delta A is

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,830
approximately 1/2
r^2 delta theta.

88
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,840
Which is practically the
same thing we had here.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,985
Except that that r is
replacing the constant there.

90
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:39,290
And it's approximately
true, because r is varying.

91
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,230
And then in the limit,
we have the exact formula

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,870
for the differential.

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,200
Which is this one.

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,190
So this is the main
formula for area.

95
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,000
And if you like, the total
area then is going to be

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,290
the integral from some starting
place to some end place of 1/2

97
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,070
r^2 d theta.

98
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,210
Now, this is only useful in
the situation that we're in.

99
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,120
Namely-- So this is the
other important formula.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
And this is only useful when
r is a function of theta.

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,930
When this is the way in which
the region is presented to us.

102
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,430
So that's the setup.

103
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,310
And that's our main formula.

104
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,884
Let's do what example.

105
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,300
The example that
I'm going to take

106
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,750
is the one that we did
at the end of last time,

107
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,790
or near the end of last time.

108
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,260
Which was this formula
here. r = 2a cos(theta).

109
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:46,920
Remember, that was the same
as (x-a)^2 + y^2 = a^2.

110
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
So this is what
we did last time.

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,550
We connected this
rectangular representation

112
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,920
to that polar representation.

113
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,130
And the picture is of a circle.

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:11,580
Where this is the point (2a, 0).

115
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,140
So let's figure out
what the area is.

116
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,480
Well, first of all,
we have to figure out

117
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,040
when we sweep out
the area, we have

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,160
to realize that we only
go from -pi/2 to pi/2.

119
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,620
So that's something we
can get from the picture.

120
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,900
You can also get it
directly from this formula

121
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,030
if you realize that cosine is
positive in this range here.

122
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,430
And at the ends, it's 0.

123
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,870
So the thing encloses
a region at these ends.

124
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:54,550
So at the ends, cosine of plus
or minus pi/2 is equal to 0.

125
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,320
That's what cinches this up
like a little sack, if you like.

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,530
So the area is now going to be
the integral from -pi/2 to pi/2

127
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,410
of 1/2 times the square of
r, that's (2a cos(theta))^2,

128
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,111
d theta.

129
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:18,610
Question.

130
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,434
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

131
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,600
PROFESSOR: How do I know
from looking at the picture

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,400
that I'm going from -pi/2
to pi/2, is the question.

133
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,820
I do it with my whole body.

134
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,860
I say, here I am pointing down.

135
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,120
That's -pi/2.

136
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,890
I sweep up, that's 0.

137
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,710
And I get all the way
up to here. that's pi/2.

138
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,910
So that's the way I do it.

139
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,450
That's really the way I
do it, I'm being honest.

140
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,520
Now if you're a machine,
you can't actually look.

141
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,800
And you don't have a body,
so you can't point your arms.

142
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,650
Then you would have
to go by the formulas.

143
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,950
And you'd have to actually use
something like this formula

144
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,900
here.

145
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,830
The fact that this is
where the loop cinches up.

146
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,750
This is where the
radius comes into 0.

147
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,270
At pi/2.

148
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,230
So you need to know that in
order to understand the range.

149
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,970
Another question.

150
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:23,089
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

151
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,630
PROFESSOR: So when
we're doing these,

152
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,000
should we just guess that
it's going to be a loop?

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,590
I'm probably going to give
you some clues as to what's

154
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,090
going on.

155
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,990
Because it's very hard to
figure these things out.

156
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,920
Sometimes it'll be bounded by
one curve and another curve,

157
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,780
and I'll say it's the thing
in between those two curves.

158
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,710
That's the kind of
thing that I could do.

159
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,590
Here, you really should
know this one in advance.

160
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,270
This is by far the
most-- or this is one

161
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,540
of the typical cases, anyway.

162
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,690
I'm going to give you
a couple more examples.

163
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,130
Don't get too
worked up over this.

164
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,400
You will somehow be
able to visualize it.

165
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,070
I'll give you some examples
to help you out with it later.

166
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,360
So here's the situation.

167
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,620
Here's my integral.

168
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,450
And now we're faced
with a trig integral.

169
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,970
Which we have to
remember how to do.

170
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,770
Now, the trig integral
here-- so first

171
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,760
let me factor out the constants.

172
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,740
This is 4a 4a^2 / 2, so it's
2a^2 integral from -pi/2

173
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,870
to pi/2 of cos^2(theta) d theta.

174
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,510
And now you have to
remember what you're

175
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,570
supposed to do at this point.

176
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,310
So think, if you
haven't done it yet,

177
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,830
this is practice you need to do.

178
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,660
This trig integral is handled
by a double angle formula.

179
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,520
As it happens, I'm
going to be giving you

180
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,670
these formulas on
the review sheet.

181
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,480
You'll see they're written
on the review sheet.

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,940
At least in some form.

183
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
So for example,
there's a formula,

184
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,480
and this will be
on the exam, too.

185
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,440
So this is the correct
formula to use here.

186
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,240
Is that this is + (1 +
cos(2theta)) / 2 d theta.

187
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,230
So that's the substitution that
you use for the cosine squared

188
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,490
in order to integrate it.

189
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,440
That serves as a little
review of trig integrals.

190
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,830
And now, this is quite easy.

191
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:27,560
This integral now is easy.

192
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,380
Why is it easy?

193
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,640
Well, because it's
the antiderivative

194
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,650
of a constant, cos(2theta),
its antiderivative

195
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,640
you're supposed to be
able to write down.

196
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,820
So the antiderivative
of 1 is theta.

197
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,510
And the antiderivative
of the cosine

198
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:50,120
is 1/2 the sine
when it's 2 theta.

199
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,930
And that is a ^2 a^2
(pi/2 - (-pi/2)).

200
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,070
And the signs go away
because they're both 0.

201
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,900
So all told we get pi a^2, which
is certainly what we would like

202
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,400
it to be.

203
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,482
It's the area of the circle.

204
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:10,190
Another question?

205
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:28,982
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

206
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,440
PROFESSOR: The
question, so I'm not

207
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,990
sure which question
you're asking.

208
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,360
I pivoted my arm around (0, 0).

209
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,550
This point, this is the point
we're talking about, (0, 0),

210
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,290
is a key point.

211
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,310
It's where I guess you could
say I stuck my elbow there.

212
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,367
Now, the reason is that
it's the place where r = 0.

213
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,950
So it's more or less the center
of the universe from the point

214
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,630
of view of this problem.

215
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,730
So it's the reference
point and if you like,

216
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,500
when you're doing this, it's a
little bit like a radar screen.

217
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,050
Everything is
centered at the origin

218
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,135
and you're taking rays
coming out from it.

219
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:10,390
And seeing where
they're going to go.

220
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,230
So for example, this
is the theta = 0 ray,

221
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,240
this is the theta = pi/4 ray.

222
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,930
This the theta = pi/2 ray.

223
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,250
And indeed, if my elbow is
right at this center here,

224
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,610
I'm pointing in those
various directions.

225
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:32,650
So that's what I had in
mind when I did that.

226
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,140
You can always get these
formulas, by the way,

227
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,120
from the original business, x =
r cos(theta), y = r sin(theta).

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,689
But it's useful to have the
geometric picture as well.

229
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,230
In other words, if
you were a machine

230
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,150
you'd have to rely
on these formulas.

231
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,480
And plot things using these.

232
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:57,090
Always.

233
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,509
Now, in terms of plotting
I want to expand your brain

234
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,050
a little bit.

235
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,810
So we need just a little bit
more practice with plotting.

236
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,870
In polar coordinates.

237
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,580
And so, the first question
that I want to ask you

238
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,370
is, what happens outside
of this range of theta?

239
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,960
In other words, what happens
if theta's beyond pi/2?

240
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,080
Can somebody see
what's happening

241
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,340
to the formulas in that case?

242
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,480
So what I'm looking at
now, let's go back to it.

243
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:35,600
What I'm looking at
is this formula here.

244
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,690
But to use the
elbow analogy here,

245
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,280
I'm swept around like this.

246
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,810
But now I'm going
to point this way.

247
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,340
I'm going to point
out over there.

248
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,450
My hand is up here in
the northwest direction.

249
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,519
So what's going to happen?

250
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,560
Somebody want to tell me?

251
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,210
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

252
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,920
PROFESSOR: It goes
around itself.

253
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,640
That's right.

254
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,400
What happens is that when r
crosses this vertical, r = 0,

255
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,210
when it crosses over
here it goes negative.

256
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,540
So although my theta is
pointing me this way,

257
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,490
the thing is going
to go backwards.

258
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,590
And there's another clue.

259
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,590
Which is very important.

260
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,290
How far backwards is it going?

261
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,370
Well, you don't actually need to
know anything but this equation

262
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,530
here, to understand that it
has to be on the same circle.

263
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,040
So when I'm pointing
this way, the things

264
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,550
points backwards to
this point over there.

265
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,012
So what happens is,
it goes around once.

266
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,470
And then when I
point out this way,

267
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,614
it sweeps around a second time.

268
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,530
It just keeps on going
around the same circle.

269
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,867
So over here it's empty.

270
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:40,700
Because it's pointing
the other way and it's

271
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,570
sweeping around the same curve.

272
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:47,600
A second time.

273
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,960
Now, if you were foolish
enough to integrate, say,

274
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,060
from 0 to 2pi or some wider
range, what would happen

275
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,810
is you would just
double the area.

276
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,970
Because you would have
swept it out twice.

277
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,890
So that's the mistake
that you'll make.

278
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,390
Sometimes you'll count things
as negative and positive.

279
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,392
But because there's
a square here,

280
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:08,725
it's always a positive quantity.

281
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:13,890
And you'll always over-count
if you go too far.

282
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,930
So that's what happens.

283
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,930
Again, it sweeps
out the same region.

284
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,890
That's because these
two equations really

285
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,050
are equivalent to each other.

286
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,080
It's just that this one
sweeps it out twice.

287
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,930
And this one doesn't say
how it's sweeping it out.

288
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,380
Yeah, another question.

289
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,046
STUDENT: Doesn't this
equation also work

290
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:34,320
if you just go from 0 to pi?

291
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,630
PROFESSOR: Does the
integration work

292
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,900
if you just go from 0 to pi?

293
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,730
The answer is yes.

294
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,884
That's a very weird
object, though.

295
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,300
Let me just show
you what that is.

296
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,360
If you started from 0 to 2pi.

297
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,120
So I'll illustrate it on here.

298
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,290
The first thing that you
swept out between 0 and pi/2

299
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,750
is this part here.

300
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,160
That was swept out.

301
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,190
And then, when you're going
around this next quadrant here,

302
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,026
you're actually sweeping
out this underside here.

303
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,900
So actually, you're
getting it because you're

304
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,710
getting half of it on one half,
and getting the other half

305
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,990
on the other quadrant.

306
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,120
So it's actually giving
you the right answer.

307
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,590
That turns out to be OK.

308
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,740
It's a little weird way
to chop up a circle.

309
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,706
But it's legal.

310
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:25,080
But of course,
that's an accident

311
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,260
of this particular figure.

312
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,830
You can't count
on that happening.

313
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,580
It's much better to
line it up exactly

314
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,240
with what the figure does.

315
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,630
So don't do that too often.

316
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,640
You might run into troubles.

317
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,110
So I'm going to give you
a couple more examples

318
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,970
of practice with these pictures.

319
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:57,080
And maybe I'm going to get
rid of this one up here.

320
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,850
So here's another favorite.

321
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,140
Here's another favorite.

322
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,000
So this, if you
like, is Example 2.

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,720
I guess we had an
Example 1 up there.

324
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,160
And now we're really
not going to try

325
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,690
to do any more area examples.

326
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,900
The area examples are
actually straightforward.

327
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,830
It's really just figuring out
what the picture looks like.

328
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:27,200
So this is examples of drawings.

329
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,890
So this one is one
that's kind of fun to do.

330
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,500
This is r = sin(2theta).

331
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,120
Something like this
is on your homework.

332
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,830
And so what happens
here is the following.

333
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,850
What happens here is
that at theta = 0,

334
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,100
that's the first place.

335
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,470
So let's just plot
a few places here.

336
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm not going to plot very many.

337
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,590
Theta = 0, I get r is 1.

338
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,940
Whoops, I get r is 0.

339
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,020
Sorry.

340
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,900
And then pi/4, that's where I
get sin(pi/2), I get 1 here.

341
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,570
For this.

342
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,400
And then again, at
pi/2 I get sin(pi),

343
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,090
which is back at 0 again.

344
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,010
So it's-- And the other thing
to say is in between here

345
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,810
it's positive.

346
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,860
In between.

347
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,120
So what it does is,
it starts out at 0

348
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,290
and it goes out to the
radius 1 over here.

349
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,640
And then it comes back.

350
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,350
So it does something like this.

351
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,790
It goes out, and it comes back.

352
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,900
Now because of the symmetries
of the sine function,

353
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,070
this is pretty much
all you need to know.

354
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,550
It does something similar
in all of the quadrants.

355
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,000
But in order to see what it's
doing, it's useful for you

356
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,450
to watch me draw it.

357
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,930
Because the order is very
important for understanding

358
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,970
what it's doing.

359
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,170
It's similar to this weird
business with the circle here.

360
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,110
So watch me draw this guy.

361
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,700
I'll draw it in red because
it usually has a name.

362
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,870
So here it is.

363
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,450
It does this thing.

364
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,280
And then it does this.

365
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,330
And then it does this.

366
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,770
And then it does that.

367
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,130
So it's called a four-leaf rose.

368
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,380
I drew it in pink because
it's kind of a rose here.

369
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,050
So it started out over here.

370
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,800
This is Step 1.

371
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,370
And this is the range
0 < theta < pi/4.

372
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,200
It did this part here.

373
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,180
And then it went 2 here.

374
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,510
So I should draw these
in white, because they're

375
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,580
harder to read in red.

376
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,800
But now look at what it did.

377
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,160
It did not make a
right angle turn.

378
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,930
It was nice and smooth.

379
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,500
It went around here and
then it went down here.

380
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
This is 3.

381
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,840
Back here, that's 4.

382
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,370
And then over here, that's 5.

383
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,540
Back up here, that's 6.

384
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,650
And then around here, that's 7.

385
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,030
And down here, that's 8.

386
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,750
And then back where it
started and goes around again.

387
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,940
And this is because
actually it's switching sign

388
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,470
when it crosses the origin.

389
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,620
When it was over in this
quadrant the first time,

390
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:28,050
it actually was tracing
what's directly behind it.

391
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,470
So this is kind of amusing.

392
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,681
From this little tiny formula
you get this pretty diagram

393
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:34,180
here.

394
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,490
Anyway that's, as I
say, an old favorite.

395
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,490
And here if you want to
do the area of one leaf,

396
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,810
you've got to make sure
you understand that it's

397
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:49,650
a small piece of the whole.

398
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,230
OK, now I have one
last drawing example

399
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,280
that I want to discuss with you.

400
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,150
And it involves another
skill that we haven't quite

401
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,550
gotten enough practice with.

402
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,320
So I'm going to do that one.

403
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,210
And it's also preparation
for an exercise.

404
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,360
But one that we're going
to do after the test.

405
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,110
So here's my last example.

406
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,300
We're going to discuss what
happens with this function

407
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,510
here.

408
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,440
Sorry, that's not
legible, is it.

409
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,790
That's a cosine. r = r
= 1/(1 + 2cos(theta)).

410
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,470
Now, the first
thing I want to do

411
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:44,400
is just take our time a little
bit and plot a few points.

412
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,260
So here's the values of theta
and here are the values of r,

413
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,770
and we'll see what happens.

414
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,450
And we'll try to figure
out what it's doing.

415
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,440
When theta = 0, cosine is 1.

416
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,230
So r = 1/3.

417
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,950
The denominator is
1 + 2, so it's 1/3.

418
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,060
If theta-- I'm going
to make it easy,

419
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,540
we're not going to do so many.

420
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm going to do pi/2, that's
an easy value of the cosine.

421
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
That's cos(pi/2) = 0.

422
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,070
So that value of r = 1.

423
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:30,060
And now I'm going to
back up and do -pi/2.

424
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,390
-pi/2, again, cosine is 0.

425
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:39,500
And r = 1.

426
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,930
So now I'd like to just plot
those points anyway, and see

427
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,410
what's going on with
this expression here.

428
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,910
The first one is a
rectangular-- I'm

429
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,450
going to write the
rectangular coordinates here,

430
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,010
not the polar coordinates.

431
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,670
The rectangular coordinates here
are 1/3 out at the horizontal,

432
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,220
so it's (1/3, 0).

433
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,300
The polar coordinates
is (1/3, 0),

434
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,890
but the rectangular
coordinate is also that.

435
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,610
And over here, at pi/2,
the distance is 1.

436
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,940
So this is the point (0,
1) in x-y coordinates.

437
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:26,940
And then down here at,
-pi/2, it's (0, -1).

438
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,817
Let me just emphasize.

439
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,650
You should be able to
think of this visually

440
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,590
if you can crank your
arm around and think it.

441
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,630
Or if you're right-handed
you'll bend that way, no.

442
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,270
Anyway.

443
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,250
Or you'll have to
use-- But this also

444
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:48,890
works using this formulas x =
r cos(theta), y = r sin(theta).

445
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,010
Notice that in this case, r
was 1 but the cosine was 0.

446
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,100
So you plug in theta = -pi/2.

447
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,990
And r = 1.

448
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,520
And lo and behold,
you get 0 here.

449
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,640
And here you get
-1 here you get 1.

450
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,830
So this is -1.

451
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,750
So this is an example.

452
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,960
I did it purely visually
or sort of organically.

453
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,190
But you can also do it by
plugging in the numbers.

454
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,130
Now in between, the
denominator is positive.

455
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,810
And it's something in between.

456
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,600
It's going to sweep around
something like this.

457
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,200
That's what happens in between.

458
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,090
As theta increases
from -pi/2 to pi/2.

459
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,430
And now something
interesting happens

460
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,260
with this particular
function, which

461
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,450
is that we notice that
the denominator is

462
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,280
0 at a certain place.

463
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,610
Namely, if I solve
2 cos(theta) = -1,

464
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,290
then the denominator
is going to be 0 there.

465
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,470
That's cos(theta) =
-1/2, so theta is equal

466
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,240
to, it turns out,
plus or minus 2pi/3.

467
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,800
Those are the values here.

468
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,050
So when we're out here
somewhere, in these directions,

469
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,120
there's nothing.

470
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,220
It's going infinitely far out.

471
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,120
Those ways.

472
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,500
OK that's about as
much as we'll be

473
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,740
able to figure out
of this diagram

474
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,980
without doing some
analytic work.

475
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,970
And that's the other little
piece that I want to explain.

476
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,700
Namely, going backwards
from polar coordinates

477
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,740
to rectangular coordinates.

478
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,930
Which is one thing
that we haven't done.

479
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,870
So let's do that.

480
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:48,680
So what is the
rectangular equation?

481
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:59,690
That means the (x, y)
equation for this r = 1 /

482
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,440
(1 + 2cos(theta)).

483
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,320
And let's see what it is.

484
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,850
Well, first I'm going to
clear the denominator here.

485
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:15,200
This is r + 2r cos(theta) = 1.

486
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,020
And now I'm going to rewrite
it as r = 1 - 2r cos(theta).

487
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,280
And the reason for that
is that in a minute

488
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,300
I'll explain to you why.

489
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,620
This is 1 - 2x.

490
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,810
And this guy, I'm
going to square now.

491
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:38,010
I'm going to make
this r^2 = (1 - 2x)^2.

492
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,030
And now, with an r^2, I
can plug in x^2 + y^2.

493
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,381
So this is a
standard thing to do.

494
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,880
And it's basically
what you're going

495
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,870
to do any time you're faced
with an equation like this.

496
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,470
Is try to work it out.

497
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,180
And, in these situations
where you have 1 /

498
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,990
(a + b cos(theta)),
or sin(theta),

499
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,400
you'll always come out with some
quadratic expression like this.

500
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,590
Now, I'm going to combine terms.

501
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,921
So here I have -3x^2 + y^2, and
put everything on the the left

502
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:20,420
side.

503
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,390
So that's this.

504
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,140
And we recognize, well
you're supposed to recognize,

505
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:36,580
that this is what's
known as a hyperbola.

506
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,620
If the signs are the
same, it's an ellipse.

507
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,390
If the the signs are
opposite it's a hyperbola.

508
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,920
And in between, if one of the
coefficients on the quadratic

509
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,210
is 0, it's a parabola.

510
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,844
So now we see that the picture
that we drew there is actually,

511
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:56,510
turns out it's going
to have asymptotes,

512
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,920
it's going to be a hyperbola.

513
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,650
So now, let me ask you the last
little mind-bending question

514
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,020
that I want to ask.

515
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,060
Which is, what happens-- So
now I'm using my right arm,

516
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,770
I guess.

517
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,190
But my elbow's at
the origin here.

518
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,290
What happens if I pass
outside, to the range where

519
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,280
this denominator is negative.

520
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,210
It crossed 0 and it
went to negative.

521
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,050
It's sweeping out
something over here.

522
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,420
Is it sweeping out
the same curve?

523
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,320
Anybody have any
idea what it's doing?

524
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,820
Yeah.

525
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

526
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

527
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,090
Good answer.

528
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,220
It's the other branch
of the hyperbola.

529
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,390
So what's actually
happening is in disguise,

530
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,015
there's another branch
of the hyperbola

531
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:50,700
which is being swept up by
the other piece of this thing.

532
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,220
Now, that is consistent with
these algebraic equations.

533
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,500
The algebraic equation
that I got here

534
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,900
doesn't say which branch
of the hyperbola I've got.

535
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,930
It's actually got two branches.

536
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,960
And the curve really
was, in disguise,

537
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,130
capturing both of them.

538
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,250
I want to make
the connection now

539
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,770
with the basic
formula for area here.

540
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,920
Because this is a really
beautiful connection.

541
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,520
And I want to make that
connection in connection

542
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,110
also with this example.

543
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,750
The hyperbolas, as
you probably know,

544
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,770
are the trajectories of comets.

545
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,290
And ellipses, which is what you
would get if maybe you put 1/2

546
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,570
here instead of a 2,
would be the trajectories

547
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,450
of planets or asteroids.

548
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,770
But there's actually
something much more important,

549
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,410
physically that goes on.

550
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,820
That's special about this
particular representation

551
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,900
of the hyperbola.

552
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,610
And what happens when you
get the ellipses as well.

553
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,860
Which is that in
this case, r = 0

554
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:17,520
is the focus of the hyperbola.

555
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,390
And what that means
is that it's actually

556
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:28,910
the place where the sun is.

557
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,220
So this is the right
representation,

558
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,670
if you want the
center of gravity

559
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,720
in the center of your picture.

560
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,540
And pretty much any other.

561
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,050
I mean, you can't
tell that at all

562
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,150
from the algebraic
equations here.

563
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,340
So this hyperbola is
going to be the trajectory

564
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,900
of some comet going by here.

565
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,240
And this formula
here is actually

566
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:05,040
a rather central
formula in astronomy.

567
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:17,100
Namely, there's something
called Kepler's Law.

568
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:23,820
Which says that the rate
of change of area which

569
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,674
is swept out is constant.

570
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:31,090
The rate of change of area
relative to the center of mass,

571
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,640
relative to the sun.

572
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,000
So in equal areas,
this is amount of area.

573
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,570
So this tells you now that when
a comet goes around the sun

574
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,500
like this, its speed varies.

575
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,180
And it's speed varies according
to a very specific rule.

576
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,220
Namely, this one here.

577
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,960
And this rule was
observed by Kepler.

578
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,910
But if you have this
connection here,

579
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,400
we also have something else.

580
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:08,390
We also know that dA/dt
= 1/2 r^2 d theta / dt.

581
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:13,387
So that's this formula here,
formally dividing by t.

582
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:14,970
That's the rate of
change with respect

583
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,040
to this time parameter, which
is the honest to goodness time.

584
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,820
Real physical time.

585
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:34,920
And that means, this
quantity here is constant.

586
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,810
And this is one of
the key insights

587
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,540
that physicists had,
long after Kepler

588
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,760
made his physical
observations, they realized

589
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,280
that he had managed to get the
best physics experiment of all,

590
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,790
because it's a
frictionless setup.

591
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,320
Outer space, there's no air.

592
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,710
Nothing is going on.

593
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:59,260
This is what's known
nowadays as conservation

594
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:10,030
of angular momentum.

595
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,720
This is the expression
for angular momentum.

596
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,810
And what Kepler was
observing, it turns out,

597
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,924
is what we see all
the time in real life.

598
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,090
Which is when you start
something spinning around it

599
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,570
continues to spin at
roughly the same rate.

600
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,517
Or, if you're an
ice skater and you

601
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,600
get yourself scrunched
together a little bit more,

602
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,330
you can spin faster.

603
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,850
And there's an exact
quantitative rule

604
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,740
that does that.

605
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,240
And it's exactly this
polar formula here.

606
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,730
So that's a neat thing.

607
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,280
And we will do a little
exercise on this rate of change

608
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,780
after the exam.

609
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,030
So that's it for generalities
and a little pep talk

610
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,940
on what's coming
up to you when you

611
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,820
learn a little more physics.

612
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:04,660
Right now we need to
talk about the exam.

613
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:14,010
So first of all, let me tell
you what the topics are.

614
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,500
They're the same as
last year's test.

615
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,990
Which you can take a look at.

616
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:24,060
And let's see.

617
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,920
So what did we do?

618
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,960
One of the main
topics of this unit

619
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,660
were techniques of integration.

620
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,390
And there are three,
which we will test.

621
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:46,660
One is trig substitution.

622
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:53,950
One is integration by parts.

623
00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:02,000
And one is partial fractions.

624
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,020
So that's more than half
of the exam, right there.

625
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:16,210
The other half of the
exam is parametric curves.

626
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,420
Arc length.

627
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,520
These are all interrelated.

628
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:33,140
And area of surfaces
of revolution.

629
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,150
Those are the only kind
that we can handle.

630
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,730
Just as we did with volume
of surfaces of revolution.

631
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:47,590
And then there's a final topic,
which is polar coordinates.

632
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:57,260
And area in polar
coordinates, including area.

633
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,810
That's it.

634
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,270
That's what's on the test,
there are six problems.

635
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,200
They're very similar.

636
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,040
Well, they're not
actually that similar.

637
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,610
But they're somewhat
similar to last year's.

638
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:13,860
I'd say the test is similar.

639
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,960
Maybe a tiny bit more
difficult. We'll see.

640
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,241
We'll see.

641
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:18,740
Yeah.

642
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,420
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

643
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,410
PROFESSOR: The question
was, we didn't do arc length

644
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,310
in polar coordinates, did we?

645
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,954
And the answer is
no, we did not.

646
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:32,870
We did not do arc length
in polar coordinates.

647
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,840
When I give you an exercise,
I'm going to ask you about,

648
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,850
if you know the speed
of a comet here, what's

649
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,540
the speed of the comet there.

650
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,710
And we'll have to know
about arc length for that.

651
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:48,534
But we're not doing
it on this exam.

652
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:49,200
Other questions.

653
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:59,880
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

654
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,650
PROFESSOR: The question is,
will I expect you to know r

655
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,220
equals--- so let's see if I
can formulate this question.

656
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,430
It's related to this
four-leaf rose here.

657
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,020
So the question is, suppose
I gave you something

658
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,220
that looked like this.

659
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,170
Would I expect you to be
able to know what it is.

660
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,300
I think the answer, the
fair answer to give you,

661
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,440
is if it's this complicated,
I only have two possibilities.

662
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,190
I can give you a long
time to sketch this out.

663
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,510
And think about what it does.

664
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,580
Or I can tell you
that it happens

665
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,600
to be a three-leaf rose.

666
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,530
And then you have some
clue as to what it's doing.

667
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,620
It doesn't have six.

668
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,770
Because of some weird thing,
having to do with repetitions.

669
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,790
But the odds and evens
work differently.

670
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,540
So, in fact I would
have to tell you

671
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,100
what the picture
looks like, if it's

672
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,070
going to be this complicated.

673
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,860
Similarly, so this is an
important point to make,

674
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,500
when we come to techniques
of integration, any integral

675
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,982
that you have, I'm not going to
tell you which of these three

676
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,440
techniques to use
on the ones which

677
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,810
are straightforward integrals.

678
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,050
But if it's an
integral that I think

679
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,760
you're going to get
stuck on, either I'm

680
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,330
going to give you a hint,
tell you how to do it.

681
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,280
Or I'm going to tell
you, don't do it.

682
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,680
If I tell you don't do
it, don't try to do it.

683
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,050
It may be impossible.

684
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,950
And even if it's possible,
it's going to be very long.

685
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,010
Like an hour.

686
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,750
So don't do it
unless I tell you to.

687
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,990
On the other hand,
all of these setups

688
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,720
in this second
half of this unit,

689
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,290
they involve somehow
setting something up.

690
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:55,230
And they're basically
three issues.

691
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,310
One is what the integrand is.

692
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:02,440
One is what the lower limit
is, what is the upper limit.

693
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,510
They're just three
things, three inputs,

694
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,710
to setting up an integral.

695
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,590
All integrals, this is going to
be the setup for all of them.

696
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,260
And then the second
step is evaluating.

697
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,070
Which really is what we
did in the first half here.

698
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,856
And, unfortunately, we don't
have infinitely many techniques

699
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,230
and indeed there's
some integrals

700
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,790
that can't be evaluated
and some that are too long.

701
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,575
So we'll just try
to avoid those.

702
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:32,400
I'm not trying to give you
ones which are hopelessly long.

703
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,680
Alright, other questions.

704
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,180
Yes.

705
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:47,620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

706
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,610
PROFESSOR: The question is, will
the percentages be the same.

707
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,834
And the answer is, no.

708
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:55,750
I'll tell you exactly.

709
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,200
This is 55 points.

710
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,340
Unless I change
the point values.

711
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:07,780
This is 55, and this is 45.

712
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,020
That's what it came out to be.

713
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,554
You are going to want to
know about all of the things

714
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,720
that I've written down here.

715
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,386
You're definitely
going to want to know,

716
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,650
for example, surfaces
of revolution.

717
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,710
How to set those up.

718
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,341
Yes. there was another
question I saw.

719
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:24,840
Yes.

720
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:50,770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

721
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:55,010
PROFESSOR: So if you have a
partial fraction with something

722
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:04,110
like (x+2)^2 and maybe
an x and maybe an x+1,

723
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:15,460
and you're interested in what
happens with this denominator

724
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,120
here?

725
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:23,600
So what's going to
happen is, you're

726
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:32,180
going to need a coefficient
for each degree of this.

727
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:40,400
So altogether, the setup
is going to be this.

728
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,080
Plus one for x.

729
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,440
And one for x+1.

730
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,770
This is the setup.

731
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,850
So you need--

732
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:58,890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

733
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:05,310
PROFESSOR: So if I change this
to being a 3 here, then I need,

734
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:10,490
I guess I'll have to
call it E, (x+2)^3.

735
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,460
I need that.

736
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,000
Now, it gets harder and harder.

737
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,500
The more repeated
roots there are,

738
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,440
the more repeated factors
there are, the harder it is.

739
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,080
Because the ones you can pick
off by the cover-up method are,

740
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,020
is just the top one here.

741
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,240
And these two.

742
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,340
So C, D, and E you can get.

743
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,170
But B and A you're
going to have to do

744
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,740
by either plugging in or some
other, more elaborate, algebra.

745
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,650
So the more of these lower
terms there are, the worse off

746
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,180
you are.

747
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:48,170
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

748
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:57,990
PROFESSOR: The question is,
does this x^3 + 21 affect this

749
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,220
setup.

750
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,290
And the answer is almost no.

751
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,790
That is, not at all.

752
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,510
It's the same setup exactly.

753
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,260
But, there's one thing.

754
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,510
If the degree gets
too big, then you've

755
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:18,270
got to use long division
first to knock it down.

756
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,910
I'll give you an example
of this type of practice.

757
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,220
Unless there are more question.

758
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,440
Yes.

759
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

760
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,944
PROFESSOR: Are you
going to have to know

761
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:29,580
how to do reduction formulas?

762
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,160
Anything that's a little out of
the ordinary like a reduction

763
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,581
formula, I will have
to coach you to do.

764
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:37,080
So, in other words,
what you'll have

765
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,280
to be able to do in that
situation is follow directions.

766
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,230
If I tell you OK,
you're faced with this,

767
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,770
then do an integration by parts.

768
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,530
And do that, then get
the reduction formula.

769
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

770
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

771
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:56,460
OK, so the question had do with
the partial fractions method.

772
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:03,250
And what happens if
you have a quadratic.

773
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:11,970
So, for instance,
if it were this,

774
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,200
this one's too disgusting.

775
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,220
I'm going to just do
it with two of them.

776
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,990
So the parts with x
and x+1 are the same.

777
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:23,760
But now you have
linear factors here.

778
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,510
(Ax + B) / (x^2 + 2).

779
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:33,310
And A-- maybe I'll call them
1, and A_2 x + (A_2 x + B_2) /

780
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:43,790
(x^2 + 2)^2 + C / x + D / (x+1).

781
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,060
This is the way it works.

782
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,100
OK, I'm going to give you
one more quick example

783
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:59,720
of an integration technique
just to liven things up.

784
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,700
Let's see.

785
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,330
So here's a somewhat
tricky example.

786
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,080
This is just a little
trickier than I

787
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,640
would give you on a test.

788
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,040
But it's the same principle, and
I may do this on a final exam.

789
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,300
So suppose you're faced
with this integral.

790
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,250
What are you going to do?

791
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,140
Integration by parts, great.

792
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,360
That's right, that's
because this guy is

793
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,820
begging to be differentiated,
to be made simpler.

794
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,290
So that means that I
want this one to be u,

795
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,190
and I want this one to be v'.

796
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,120
And I want to use
integration by parts.

797
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:48,400
And then u ' = 1 /
(1+x^2), and v = x^2 / 2.

798
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:58,200
So the answer is now, x^2
/ x^2/2 tan^(-1) x minus

799
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,160
the integral of this guy.

800
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,530
Which is going to be x^2 / 2.

801
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,040
And then I have
1 / (1 + x^2) dx.

802
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,300
Now, you are not
done at this point.

803
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,780
You're still in
slightly hot water.

804
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,010
You're in tepid water, anyway.

805
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,470
So what is it that
you have to do here?

806
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,280
You're faced with
this integral, which

807
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:30,777
I'll put on the next board.

808
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:32,360
It's a lot simpler
than the other one,

809
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,970
but as I say you're not
quite out of the woods.

810
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,570
You're faced with
the integral of 1/2--

811
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:42,410
-1/2 x^2 / (1 + x^2) dx. dx.

812
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:50,350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR:
Trig substitution actually,

813
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,914
interestingly, will work.

814
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:54,580
But that wasn't what
I wanted you to do.

815
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,200
I wanted you to, yeah, go ahead.

816
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,430
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

817
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,450
PROFESSOR: Add and subtract
1 to the numerator.

818
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,330
So now, that's the
correct answer.

819
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,850
This is the case where the
numerator and the denominator

820
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,200
are tied.

821
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,270
And so you have to
use long division.

822
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,690
But a shortcut is
just to observe

823
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,300
that the result of
long division is

824
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:20,920
the same thing as doing this.

825
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,360
And then noticing that
this is 1 - 1 / (1 + x^2).

826
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,040
So this is the same as long
division, in this case.

827
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,970
Because when you divide in, it
goes in with a quotient of 1.

828
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:43,509
And so this guy turns out to
be -1/2 the integral of 1 -

829
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:44,050
1/(1+x^2) dx.

830
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:55,000
Which is 1/2 x -
1/2 tan^(-1) x + c.

831
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:02,230
So this is one extra step that
you may be faced with someday

832
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,900
in your life.

833
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,620
And just keep that in mind.
