00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,830

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,410
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,680
In this video, I'd like us to
do the following problem,

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,700
which is going to be relating
polar and Cartesian

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,720
coordinates.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,110
So I want you to write each of
the following in Cartesian

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,060
coordinates, and that means our
x y coordinates, and then

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,420
describe the curve.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,320
So the first one is r squared
equals 4r cosine theta, and

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,860
the second one is r equals 9
tangent theta secant theta.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,250
So again, what I'd like you to
do is convert each of these to

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,450
something in the Cartesian
coordinates, in the x y

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,430
coordinates, and then I want you
to describe what the curve

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,680
actually looks like.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,550
So I'll give you a little while
to work on it, and then

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,030
when I come back, I'll
show you how I do it.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,390

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,430
OK, welcome back.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,530
Well, hopefully you were able
to get pretty far in

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,300
describing these two curves
in x y coordinates.

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,860
And I will show you how I
attacked these problems. So

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,070
we'll start with a.

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,630
So for A--

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,630
I'm going to rewrite the problem
up here, so we can

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,870
just be focused on
what's up here.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,360
So we had r squared equals
4r cosine theta.

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, we know what
r squared is.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,250
That's nice in terms of
x and y coordinates.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,620
That's just x squared
plus y squared.

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,710
So we know that, so we'll
replace that.

31
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,780
And then we can actually replace
all the r's and thetas

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,480
over here pretty easily,
as well.

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,270
Because we know r cosine
theta describes x.

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,570
So the cartesian coordinate x
is the polar coordinate--

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,790
or described in polar
coordinates as r cosine theta.

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,500
So we can just write
that as 4x.

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,410
And the reason I asked you to
describe the curve is because

38
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,020
from here, you could say, oh,
well I wrote it in the

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,910
Cartesian coordinates.

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,910
I wrote it in x y, and
so now I'm done.

41
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:06,010
But the point is that you can
actually work on this equation

42
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,130
right here and get into a form
that you can recognize.

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,320
That it'll be a recognizable
curve.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,910
So let's see if we can sort of
play around with this, and

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,060
come up with something
that looks familiar.

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,590
And what you might think to do,
would be, say, you know,

47
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,170
subtract off the x squared, or
subtract off the y squared.

48
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,670
Try and solve for x
or solve for y.

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,980
But that can be a little bit
dangerous in this situation,

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,470
because in fact, y might
not be a function of x.

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,310
So we might run into
some trouble there.

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,290
But if you'll notice, there's
something kind of, a glaring

53
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,940
way we should go.

54
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,880
And that's because we have this
x squared plus y squared

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,550
together-- this maybe could look
something like a circle

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,270
or an ellipse or something like
that, if we could figure

57
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,260
out a way to put this part
in with the x squared.

58
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,980
So this is kind of--

59
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,210
it's a good way to think
about what direction to

60
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,320
head in this problem.

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,720
In particular, it would be a bad
idea for this problem for

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,560
you to subtract x squared
and take the square

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,070
root of both sides.

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,450
Because you would lose some
information about

65
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,070
what this curve was.

66
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,360
OK?

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,350
Because when you take the square
root, you would have to

68
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,100
say, well, do I want the
positive square root, or do I

69
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,120
want the negative square root?

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,170
We'd lose a little bit
of information.

71
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,250
So we do not want
to solve for y.

72
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,850
So let's do what I said.

73
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,890
Let's try and figure out a way
to get this 4x into something

74
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,610
to do with this x
squared term.

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:31,360
So I'm going to subtract 4x and
rewrite the equation here.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,150
And so you might say, well,
Christine, this doesn't really

77
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,130
seem that helpful.

78
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,070
It's just the same thing
moved around.

79
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,170
But we're going to use one of
our favorite techniques from

80
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,250
integration, which is completing
the square.

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,230
So we can actually complete the
square on this guy right

82
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,670
here, and turn it into
a perfect square.

83
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,030
We'll have to add an extra term,
but once we do that,

84
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,070
we'll have a perfect
square, an extra

85
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,060
term, and a y squared.

86
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,830
And we're getting more into
the form of something that

87
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,630
actually looks like a circle.

88
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,280
So let's see.

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,170
Completing the square on this,
it's going to be x squared

90
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,140
minus 4x plus 4.

91
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,110
How did I know that?

92
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,830
Well, if I want to complete
the square on this, I need

93
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,260
something that, multiplied by
2, gives me negative 4.

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,250
That's 2.

95
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,030
And then 2 squared is 4.

96
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,700
So that's where the
4 comes in.

97
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,960
To keep this equal, I'll add 4
to the other side, as well.

98
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,010
So if I add 4 to both sides, I
haven't changed the equality,

99
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,470
and I keep my y squared
along for the ride.

100
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,560
So now I have a perfect
square.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,640
What does this give me?

102
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,745
This gives me x minus 2 quantity
squared plus 4-- plus

103
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:38,380
four squared-- plus y squared.

104
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,080
So x minus 2 quantity squared.

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,000
That came from these
three terms. Plus y

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,850
squared equals four.

107
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,070
And now it's a curve we
can describe, clearly.

108
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,110
What curve is this?

109
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,370
Well, it's obviously a circle.

110
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,180
It's centered at the point 2
comma 0, and it has radius 2.

111
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,920
We've talked, or you've seen
this in the lecture videos.

112
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,900
I believe what the form for a
circle is, x minus a quality

113
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,680
squared plus y minus b quantity

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,290
squared equals r squared.

115
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,345
So this is, a is 2, b is 0, and
r is 2. so it's a circle

116
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,230
of radius 2, centered
at 2 comma 0.

117
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,270
So we have a good way to
describe what started off in

118
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,630
polar coordinates.

119
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,030
We can now describe it
in x y coordinates.

120
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,320
OK.

121
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,910
So now let's move on to B. And
I'm going to rewrite B over

122
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,230
here as well, so we don't
have to worry

123
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,220
about it, looking back.

124
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:45,420
r equals 9 tan theta
secant theta.

125
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,810
OK.

126
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,680
So let's look at this.

127
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,870
Now, there's some information
buried in here, in terms of x

128
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,120
y coordinates.

129
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,180
And one thing that should stand
out to you is, what is

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,580
secant theta?

131
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,510
Secant theta is 1 over
cosine theta.

132
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:58,790
Right?

133
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,780
And if we have 1 over cosine
theta over here, we can

134
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,000
multiply both sides by cosine
theta, and we get an r cosine

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,420
theta over here.

136
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,590
So I'm going to write
that down.

137
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,320
That this actually
is in the same--

138
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,750
this is the same as r cosine
theta equals 9 tan theta.

139
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,370
Right?

140
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,860
I mean, you could get mad at me
about where this is defined

141
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,620
in terms of theta, but I'm not
worrying about that in this

142
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,540
situation, just right now.

143
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,560
We're just trying to figure
out how we could write

144
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,320
this in x and y.

145
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,870
We know what our cosine
theta is.

146
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,830
Again, it's x, as
it was before.

147
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,090
What about tan theta?

148
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,900
Tangent theta, remember, if you
recall, this tangent theta

149
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,610
is opposite over adjacent,
right?

150
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,100
And in this case, opposite is
the y, and adjacent is the x.

151
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,310
This is something you saw a
picture of, you can see a

152
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,190
picture of pretty easily.

153
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,950
So this is x is equal
to 9 times y over x.

154
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,340
Right?

155
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,770
Which is x squared
is equal 9y.

156
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,840
So this is in fact how you could
write this expression

157
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,740
that's in r and theta
in terms of x and y.

158
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,160
And so this, if you look at
it, is actually a parabola

159
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,420
that goes through the point 0,
0, and is stretched by a

160
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,040
factor of 9, or 1/9.

161
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,630
Well, I guess you can say,
there's a vertical stretch or

162
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,510
horizontal stretch, you can
pick which one it is.

163
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,940
And in one case, it's going
to be by 3 or 1/3.

164
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,100
I always mix those up.

165
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,990
I'd have to check.

166
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,520
Or by 9 or 1/9.

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,710
So essentially, it's going to
be a parabola with some

168
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,240
stretching on it.

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,650
Now, the problem is that you
might say, well, it's not

170
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,440
really all of that.

171
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,850
Because secant theta is not
going to be defined for all

172
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,170
theta the way cosine is.

173
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,690
So you do potentially run into
some problems. You might have

174
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,580
to worry about what part of
the domain makes sense for

175
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,380
theta, so that this
is well-defined.

176
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,230
And so that this is
well-defined, what part of the

177
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,510
curve is carved out.

178
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,205
That's a little more technical
than I want

179
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,680
to go in this video.

180
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,760
But some of you might look
at it and say, oh,

181
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,720
she's missing something.

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,050
Yeah, you caught something
that I'm

183
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,730
intentionally ignoring.

184
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,490
So the main point of this was
just so that you could see how

185
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,480
you can take these functions of
r and theta and turn them

186
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,120
into functions of x and y, and
then figure out kind of what

187
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,330
the curves might look like.

188
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,600
So I'm going to stop there.

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,420
Hopefully this was a good
exercise to get you

190
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,080
understanding how these
different coordinates relate

191
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,240
to one another.

192
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,810
And yeah, that's where
we'll leave it.
