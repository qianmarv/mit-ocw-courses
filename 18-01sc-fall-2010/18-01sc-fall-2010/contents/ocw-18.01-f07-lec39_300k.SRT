9
00:00:21,58 --> 00:00:27,7
PROFESSOR: So, Professor
Jerison is relaxing in sunny

10
00:00:27,7 --> 00:00:31,8
London, Ontario today and sent
me in as his substitute again.

11
00:00:32,13 --> 00:00:33,76
I'm glad to the here
and see you all again.

12
00:00:33,76 --> 00:00:39,19



13
00:00:39,19 --> 00:00:43,31
He said that he'd already
talked about power series and

14
00:00:43,31 --> 00:00:49,605
Taylor's formula oh on last
week right, on Friday?

15
00:00:50,85 --> 00:00:53,99
So I'm going to go a little
further with that and show you

16
00:00:53,99 --> 00:00:58,25
some examples, show you some
applications, and then I have

17
00:00:58,25 --> 00:01:02,58
this course evaluation survey
that I'll hand out in the last

18
00:01:02,58 --> 00:01:03,805
10 minutes or so of the class.


19
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,89



20
00:01:06,89 --> 00:01:10,5
I also have this handout that
he made that says 18.01

21
00:01:10,5 --> 00:01:11,44
end of term, 2007.


22
00:01:12,52 --> 00:01:15,69
If you didn't pick this up
coming in, grab it going out.

23
00:01:15,69 --> 00:01:17,99
People tend not to pick it up
when they walk in, I see.

24
00:01:18,85 --> 00:01:20,28
So grab this when
you're going out.

25
00:01:22,01 --> 00:01:23,39
There's some things
missing from it.

26
00:01:23,39 --> 00:01:27,37
He has not decided when
his office hours will

27
00:01:27,37 --> 00:01:28,52
be at the end of term.


28
00:01:28,52 --> 00:01:30,975
He will have them, just
hasn't decided when.

29
00:01:31,28 --> 00:01:34,575
So, check the website
for that information.

30
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:38



31
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40,91
And we're looking forward
to the final exam, which

32
00:01:40,91 --> 00:01:47,03
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


33
00:01:47,03 --> 00:01:49,59
Any questions about
this technical stuff?

34
00:01:49,59 --> 00:01:52,9



35
00:01:52,9 --> 00:01:55,21
All right, let's talk about
power series for a little bit.

36
00:01:56,86 --> 00:02:00,56
So I thought I should review
for you what the story

37
00:02:00,56 --> 00:02:01,98
with power series is.


38
00:02:01,98 --> 00:02:21,79



39
00:02:21,79 --> 00:02:23,22
OK, could I have your
attention please?

40
00:02:23,22 --> 00:02:26,92



41
00:02:26,92 --> 00:02:31,64
So, power series is a way of
writing a function as a sum

42
00:02:31,64 --> 00:02:33,165
of interval powers of x.


43
00:02:33,56 --> 00:02:36,413
These a, 0, a1, and
so on, are numbers.

44
00:02:38,09 --> 00:02:43,06
An example of a power
series is a polynomial.

45
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:48,05



46
00:02:48,05 --> 00:02:55,35
Not to be forgotten, one type
of power series is one which

47
00:02:55,35 --> 00:02:59,51
goes on for a finite number of
terms and then ends, so that

48
00:02:59,51 --> 00:03:02,715
all of the all the higher
a sub i's are all 0.

49
00:03:03,65 --> 00:03:06,15
This is a perfectly good
example of a power series

50
00:03:06,15 --> 00:03:08,075
it's a very special
kind of power series.

51
00:03:09,04 --> 00:03:11,94
Part of what I want to tell you
today is that power series

52
00:03:11,94 --> 00:03:14,55
behave, if almost exactly
like, polynomials.

53
00:03:14,97 --> 00:03:17,66
There's just one thing that you
have to be careful about when

54
00:03:17,66 --> 00:03:21,54
you're using power series
that isn't a concern for

55
00:03:21,54 --> 00:03:23,93
polynomials, and I'll show you
what that is in a minute.

56
00:03:24,54 --> 00:03:26,89
So, you should think of them
as generalized polynomials.

57
00:03:29,32 --> 00:03:45,85
The one thing that you have
to be careful about is that

58
00:03:45,85 --> 00:03:54,73
there's a number, which I'll
call r, where r can be between

59
00:03:54,73 --> 00:03:57,07
0 and it can also be ifninity.


60
00:03:57,35 --> 00:04:03,41
It's a number between 0 and
infinity, inclusive, so that

61
00:04:03,41 --> 00:04:06,83
when the absolute value
of x is less than r.

62
00:04:06,83 --> 00:04:11,26
So when x is smaller than r
in size, the sum converges.

63
00:04:11,26 --> 00:04:17,22



64
00:04:17,22 --> 00:04:20,13
that's sum converges
to a finite value.

65
00:04:21,17 --> 00:04:25,12
And when x is bigger than
r in absolute value,

66
00:04:25,12 --> 00:04:26,05
the sum diverges.


67
00:04:26,05 --> 00:04:30,26



68
00:04:30,26 --> 00:04:32,165
This r is called the
radius of convergence.

69
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:42,96



70
00:04:42,96 --> 00:04:45,75
So we'll see some examples of
what the radius of convergence

71
00:04:45,75 --> 00:04:49,625
is in various powers series as
well, and how you find it also.

72
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:55,89



73
00:04:55,89 --> 00:05:00,55
Let me go on and give you a few
more of the properties about

74
00:05:00,55 --> 00:05:02,98
power series which I think
that professor Jerison

75
00:05:02,98 --> 00:05:04,99
talked about earlier.


76
00:05:05,41 --> 00:05:07,27
So one of them is there's
a radius of convergence.

77
00:05:08,74 --> 00:05:10,2
Here's another one.


78
00:05:10,2 --> 00:05:15,76



79
00:05:15,76 --> 00:05:21,09
If you're inside of the radius
convergence, then the function

80
00:05:21,09 --> 00:05:22,01
has all it's derivatives.


81
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:34,265
It has all it's derivatives,
just like a polynomial does.

82
00:05:34,53 --> 00:05:36,545
You can differentiate it
over and over again.

83
00:05:37,21 --> 00:05:46,1
In terms of those derivatives,
the number a sub n in the power

84
00:05:46,1 --> 00:05:48,85
series can be expressed in
terms of the value of

85
00:05:48,85 --> 00:05:50,38
the derivative at 0.


86
00:05:52 --> 00:05:53,7
And this is called
Taylor's formula.

87
00:05:53,7 --> 00:05:58,54



88
00:05:58,54 --> 00:06:02,5
So I'm saying that inside of
this radius of convergence, the

89
00:06:02,5 --> 00:06:06,57
function that we're looking at,
this f of x, can be written as

90
00:06:06,57 --> 00:06:12,63
the value of the function at 0,
that's a sub 0, plus the

91
00:06:12,63 --> 00:06:13,505
value of the derivative.


92
00:06:13,83 --> 00:06:17,25
This bracket n means you take
the derivative n times.

93
00:06:17,63 --> 00:06:21,4
So, when n is one, you take the
derivative once at 0 divided

94
00:06:21,4 --> 00:06:24,82
by one factorial, which is
one, and multiplied by x.

95
00:06:25,1 --> 00:06:26,876
That's the linear term
in the power series.

96
00:06:27,63 --> 00:06:30,005
Then, the qaudratic term is you
take the second derivative.

97
00:06:30,26 --> 00:06:33,13
Remember to divide by 2
factorial which is 2.

98
00:06:33,74 --> 00:06:37,45
Multiply that by x
squared and so on out.

99
00:06:39,73 --> 00:06:44,28
So, the coefficients in the
power series just record the

100
00:06:44,28 --> 00:06:47,9
values of derivatives of the
function at x equals 0.

101
00:06:48,08 --> 00:06:50,045
They Can be computed
that way also.

102
00:06:52,27 --> 00:06:52,83
Let's see.


103
00:06:53,16 --> 00:06:55,76
I think that's a end of
my summary of things

104
00:06:55,76 --> 00:06:57,07
that he talked about.


105
00:06:57,07 --> 00:06:59,28
I think he did one example,
and I'll repeat that

106
00:06:59,28 --> 00:07:03,415
example of a power series.


107
00:07:04,68 --> 00:07:06,83
This example wasn't due
to David Jerison; it was

108
00:07:06,83 --> 00:07:07,86
due to Leonard Euler.


109
00:07:07,86 --> 00:07:11,59



110
00:07:11,59 --> 00:07:15,49
It's the example of where the
function is the exponential

111
00:07:15,49 --> 00:07:16,53
function e to the x.


112
00:07:16,53 --> 00:07:19,28



113
00:07:19,28 --> 00:07:22,02
So, let's see.


114
00:07:22,98 --> 00:07:26,04
I will just repeat for you the
computations of the power

115
00:07:26,04 --> 00:07:28,13
series for e to the x,
just because it's such an

116
00:07:28,13 --> 00:07:29,24
important thing to do.


117
00:07:30,46 --> 00:07:32,71
So, in order to do that, I have
to know what the derivative of

118
00:07:32,71 --> 00:07:35,411
e to the x is, and what the
second derivative of e to the x

119
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:41,25
is, and so on, because that
comes into the Taylor formula

120
00:07:41,25 --> 00:07:41,67
for the coefficients.


121
00:07:42,69 --> 00:07:44,94
But we know what the
derivaative of e to the x is,

122
00:07:44,94 --> 00:07:49
it's just e to the x again, and
it's that way all the way down.

123
00:07:49,31 --> 00:07:52,45
All the derivatives are e to
the x over and over again.

124
00:07:53,31 --> 00:07:57,31
So when I evaluate this at x
equal 0, well, the value of e

125
00:07:57,31 --> 00:08:01,415
to the x is one, the value of e
to the x is one and x equals 0.

126
00:08:01,91 --> 00:08:04,88
You get a value of one
all the way down.

127
00:08:05,18 --> 00:08:08,765
So all these derivatives
at 0 have the value one.

128
00:08:10,09 --> 00:08:16,49
And now, when I plug into this
formula, I find e to the x is

129
00:08:16,49 --> 00:08:24,62
1, plus 1 times x, plus 1 over
2 factorial times x squared

130
00:08:24,62 --> 00:08:30,95
plus 1 over 3 factorial
times x cubed and so on.

131
00:08:32,25 --> 00:08:35,22
So all of these numbers are
one, and all you wind up

132
00:08:35,22 --> 00:08:36,769
with is the factorials
and the denominators.

133
00:08:37,13 --> 00:08:38,87
That's the power series
for e to the x.

134
00:08:38,87 --> 00:08:40,68
This was a discovery
of Leonhard Euler in

135
00:08:40,68 --> 00:08:42,05
1740 or something.


136
00:08:42,05 --> 00:08:42,842
Yes Ma'am.


137
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,554
AUDIENCE: When your writing out
the power series, how far do

138
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:46,458
you have to write it out?


139
00:08:46,91 --> 00:08:48,7
PROFESSOR: How far do you have
to write the power series

140
00:08:48,7 --> 00:08:49,96
before it becomes well defined?


141
00:08:51,1 --> 00:08:54,34
Before its a satisfactory
solution to an exam problem,

142
00:08:54,34 --> 00:08:56,32
I suppose, is another way
to phrase the question.

143
00:08:57,71 --> 00:09:00,06
Write until you can see
what the pattern is.

144
00:09:00,92 --> 00:09:02,23
I can see what the pattern is.


145
00:09:02,23 --> 00:09:03,94
Is there anyone who's in
doubt about what the

146
00:09:03,94 --> 00:09:05,8
next term might be?


147
00:09:07,89 --> 00:09:09,9
Some people would tell you
that you have to write the

148
00:09:09,9 --> 00:09:11,44
summation convention thing.


149
00:09:11,9 --> 00:09:12,49
Don't believe them.


150
00:09:13,91 --> 00:09:15,82
If you right out enough
terms to make it clear,

151
00:09:15,82 --> 00:09:16,605
that's good enough.


152
00:09:17,02 --> 00:09:17,33
OK?


153
00:09:19,24 --> 00:09:20,07
Is that an answer for you?


154
00:09:20,07 --> 00:09:21,042
AUDIENCE: Yes, Thank you.


155
00:09:22,99 --> 00:09:25,98
PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
a basic example.

156
00:09:25,98 --> 00:09:28,96
Let's do another basic
example of a powers series.

157
00:09:28,96 --> 00:09:31,56
Oh yes, and by the way,
whenever you write out a power

158
00:09:31,56 --> 00:09:34,745
series, you should say what the
readius of convergence is.

159
00:09:35,24 --> 00:09:37,83
For now, I will just to tell
you that the radius of

160
00:09:37,83 --> 00:09:41,14
convergence of this power
series is infiinity; that is,

161
00:09:41,14 --> 00:09:44,95
this sum always convergence
for any value of x.

162
00:09:46,33 --> 00:09:48,12
I'll say a little more about
that in a few minutes.

163
00:09:49,78 --> 00:09:51,933
AUDIENCE: Which functions can
be written as power series?

164
00:09:52,88 --> 00:09:54,95
PROFESSOR: Which functions can
be written as power series?

165
00:09:57,06 --> 00:09:58,335
That's an excellent question.


166
00:10:00,03 --> 00:10:06,38
Any function that has a
reasonable expression can be

167
00:10:06,38 --> 00:10:07,575
written as a power series.


168
00:10:08,84 --> 00:10:11,22
I'm not giving you a very good
answer because the true answer

169
00:10:11,22 --> 00:10:12,26
is a little bit complicated.


170
00:10:12,73 --> 00:10:16,05
But any of the functions that
occur in Calculus like sines

171
00:10:16,05 --> 00:10:19,66
cosines, tangents, they all
have power series

172
00:10:19,66 --> 00:10:21,22
expansions, OK?


173
00:10:21,74 --> 00:10:27,07
We'll see more examples
Let's do another example.

174
00:10:27,07 --> 00:10:28,005
Here's another example.


175
00:10:30,13 --> 00:10:31,52
I guess this was example one.


176
00:10:31,52 --> 00:10:35,52



177
00:10:35,52 --> 00:10:39,805
So, this example, I think, was
due to Newton, not Euler.

178
00:10:42,14 --> 00:10:46,33
Let's find the power series
expansion of this function,

179
00:10:46,33 --> 00:10:47,78
1 over 1 plus x.


180
00:10:48,2 --> 00:10:52,43
Well, I think that somewhere
along the line, you learned

181
00:10:52,43 --> 00:10:57,23
about the geometric series
which tells you what the

182
00:10:57,23 --> 00:10:59,37
answer to this is, and
I'll just write it out.

183
00:11:00,19 --> 00:11:12,49
The geometric series tells you
that this function can be

184
00:11:12,49 --> 00:11:16,01
written as an alternating
sum of powers of x.

185
00:11:16,46 --> 00:11:18,81
You may wonder where
these minuses came from.

186
00:11:18,81 --> 00:11:21,3
Well, if you really think about
the geometric series, as you

187
00:11:21,3 --> 00:11:24,63
probably remembered, there was
a minus sign here, and

188
00:11:24,63 --> 00:11:26,54
that gets replaced by
these minus signs.

189
00:11:28,42 --> 00:11:30,27
I think maybe Jerison
talked about this also.

190
00:11:31,81 --> 00:11:33,96
Anyway, here's another
basic example.

191
00:11:34,64 --> 00:11:37,07
Remember what the graph of
this function looks like when

192
00:11:37,07 --> 00:11:39,77
x is equal to minus one.


193
00:11:41,62 --> 00:11:43,86
There's a little problem here
because the denominator

194
00:11:43,86 --> 00:11:47,6
become 0, so the graph
has a poll there.

195
00:11:47,6 --> 00:11:53,84
It goes up to infinity at x
equals minus one, and that's an

196
00:11:53,84 --> 00:11:58,52
indication that the radius of
convergence is not infinity.

197
00:11:59,15 --> 00:12:01,74
If you try to converge to this
infinite number by putting

198
00:12:01,74 --> 00:12:04,6
in x equals minus one here,
you'll have a big problem.

199
00:12:04,93 --> 00:12:07,49
In fact, you see when you put
in x equals minus one, you keep

200
00:12:07,49 --> 00:12:09,8
getting one in every term, and
it gets bigger and bigger

201
00:12:09,8 --> 00:12:10,705
and does not converge.


202
00:12:11,39 --> 00:12:14,94
In this example, the radius
of convergence is one.

203
00:12:14,94 --> 00:12:18,57



204
00:12:18,57 --> 00:12:21,795
OK, so, let's do a
new example now.

205
00:12:22,21 --> 00:12:25,41
Oh, and by the way, I should
say you can calculate these

206
00:12:25,41 --> 00:12:27,47
numbers using Taylor's formula.


207
00:12:27,77 --> 00:12:29,94
If you haven't seen
it, check it out.

208
00:12:29,94 --> 00:12:36,58
Calculate The iterated
derivatives of this function

209
00:12:36,58 --> 00:12:40,35
and plug in x equals 0 and see
that you get plus one, minus

210
00:12:40,35 --> 00:12:41,93
one, plus one, minus
one, and so on.

211
00:12:41,93 --> 00:12:42,23
Yes sir.


212
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:46,29
AUDIENCE: Per the radius of
convergence as stated, if you

213
00:12:46,29 --> 00:12:48,09
do minus one it'll fall out.


214
00:12:48,09 --> 00:12:50,37
If you put in one though,
seems like it would be fine.

215
00:12:50,74 --> 00:12:53,52
PROFESSOR: The questions is I
can see that there's a problem

216
00:12:53,52 --> 00:12:56,71
at x equals minus one, why is
there also a problem at x

217
00:12:56,71 --> 00:12:59,24
equals one where the graph
is perfectly smooth and

218
00:12:59,24 --> 00:13:00,38
innocuous and finite.


219
00:13:00,76 --> 00:13:03,04
That's another
excellent question.

220
00:13:04,49 --> 00:13:08,28
The problem is, that if you go
off to a radius of one in any

221
00:13:08,28 --> 00:13:10,97
direction and there's
a problem, that's it.

222
00:13:11,53 --> 00:13:13,19
That's what the radius
of convergence is.

223
00:13:13,53 --> 00:13:17,68
Here, what does happen if I
put an x equals plus one?

224
00:13:18,07 --> 00:13:19,54
So, let' look at
the partial sums.

225
00:13:20,49 --> 00:13:22,705
Do x equals plus one
in your mind here.

226
00:13:23,06 --> 00:13:27,85
So I'll get a partial sum
one, then 0, then one,

227
00:13:27,85 --> 00:13:29,675
then 0, then one.


228
00:13:29,99 --> 00:13:32,09
So even though it doesn't go
up to infinity, it still

229
00:13:32,09 --> 00:13:32,9
does not converge.


230
00:13:32,9 --> 00:13:35,046
AUDIENCE: And
anything in between?

231
00:13:35,5 --> 00:13:38,47
PROFESSOR: Any of these other
things will also fail to

232
00:13:38,47 --> 00:13:39,47
converge in this example.


233
00:13:41,33 --> 00:13:43,93
Well, that's the only two
real numbers at the edge.

234
00:13:43,93 --> 00:13:46,94



235
00:13:46,94 --> 00:13:49,05
OK, let's do a
different example now.

236
00:13:49,05 --> 00:13:50,793
How about a trig function?


237
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:55,422



238
00:13:55,422 --> 00:14:00,38
I'm going to compute the power
series expansion for the sine

239
00:14:00,38 --> 00:14:03,7
of x, and I'm going to do
it using Taylor's formula.

240
00:14:04,4 --> 00:14:07,17
So Taylor's formula says that
I have to start computing

241
00:14:07,17 --> 00:14:09,585
derivatives of the sine of x.


242
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:22,1



243
00:14:22,1 --> 00:14:23,83
Sounds like it's going
to be a lot of work.

244
00:14:25,28 --> 00:14:28,005
Let's see, the derivative
of the sine is the cosine.

245
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,87



246
00:14:30,87 --> 00:14:33,59
and the derivative of the
cosine, the second derivative

247
00:14:33,59 --> 00:14:35,51
of the sine, is what?


248
00:14:36,53 --> 00:14:39,88
Remember the minus,
it's minus sine of x.

249
00:14:40,27 --> 00:14:42,94
OK, now I want to take the
third derivative of the sine,

250
00:14:42,94 --> 00:14:46,02
which is the derivative of
sine, prime, prime, so it's

251
00:14:46,02 --> 00:14:47,12
the derivative of this.


252
00:14:47,76 --> 00:14:50,72
And we just decided to
derivative of sine is cosine,

253
00:14:50,72 --> 00:14:53,73
so I get cosine, but I have
this minus sign in front.

254
00:14:53,73 --> 00:14:56,66



255
00:14:56,66 --> 00:15:00,32
And now I want to differentiate
again, so the cosine becomes a

256
00:15:00,32 --> 00:15:04,52
minus sine, and that minus sine
cancels with this minus

257
00:15:04,52 --> 00:15:06,795
sine to give me sine.


258
00:15:08,02 --> 00:15:08,52
of x.


259
00:15:08,52 --> 00:15:09,11
You follow that?


260
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:12,31
It's a lot of minus one's
canceling out there.

261
00:15:13,66 --> 00:15:18,22
So, all of a sudden, I'm right
back where I started; these two

262
00:15:18,22 --> 00:15:21,16
are the same and the
pattern will now repeat

263
00:15:21,16 --> 00:15:22
forever and ever.


264
00:15:22,78 --> 00:15:25,15
Higher and higher derivatives
of sines are just plus or

265
00:15:25,15 --> 00:15:26,87
minus sines and cosines.


266
00:15:28,83 --> 00:15:33,79
Now Taylor's formula says I
should now substitute x equals

267
00:15:33,79 --> 00:15:36,67
0 into this and see what
happens, so let's do that.

268
00:15:37,58 --> 00:15:42,9
When x is equals to 0, the sine
is 0 and the cosine is one.

269
00:15:43,24 --> 00:15:46,365
The sine is 0, so
minus 0 is also 0.

270
00:15:47,41 --> 00:15:51,46
The cosine is one, but now
there's a minus one, and now

271
00:15:51,46 --> 00:15:56,68
I'm back where I started, and
so the pattern will repeat.

272
00:15:58,76 --> 00:16:02,69
OK, so the values of the
derivatives are all 0es and

273
00:16:02,69 --> 00:16:06,64
plus and minus ones and they go
through that pattern, four-fold

274
00:16:06,64 --> 00:16:08,48
periodicity, over
and over again.

275
00:16:09,67 --> 00:16:14,53
So we can write out what
the sine of x is using

276
00:16:14,53 --> 00:16:15,41
Taylor's formula.


277
00:16:15,41 --> 00:16:18



278
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22,01
So I put in the value at
0 which is 0, then I put

279
00:16:22,01 --> 00:16:26,8
in the derivative which
is 1 multiplied by x.

280
00:16:27,62 --> 00:16:31,52
Then, I have the second
derivative divided by 2

281
00:16:31,52 --> 00:16:34,79
factorial, but the second
derivatve at 0 is 0.

282
00:16:35,15 --> 00:16:36,83
So I'm going to drop
that term out.

283
00:16:38,28 --> 00:16:41,365
Now I have the third derivative
which is minus one.

284
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,93



285
00:16:43,93 --> 00:16:46,29
Remember the 3 factorial
in the denominator.

286
00:16:46,79 --> 00:16:48,125
That's the coefficient
of x cubed.

287
00:16:50,05 --> 00:16:50,91
What's the fourth derivative?


288
00:16:51,68 --> 00:16:53,4
Well, here we are, it's
on the board, it's 0.

289
00:16:54,4 --> 00:16:58,15
So I drop that term out
go up to the fifth term,

290
00:16:58,15 --> 00:16:59,39
the fifth power of x.


291
00:16:59,83 --> 00:17:01,995
It's derivative is now one.


292
00:17:02,26 --> 00:17:06,29
We've gone through the pattern
and we're back at plus one as

293
00:17:06,29 --> 00:17:09,86
the value of the iterated
derivative, so now I get 1/5

294
00:17:09,86 --> 00:17:12,28
factorial times x to the fifth.


295
00:17:13,18 --> 00:17:15,72
Now, you tell me, have we
done enough terms to see

296
00:17:15,72 --> 00:17:16,66
what the pattern is?


297
00:17:17,9 --> 00:17:22,17
I guess an x term will be
a minus 1/7 factorial

298
00:17:22,17 --> 00:17:23,03
x to the seventh.


299
00:17:23,75 --> 00:17:25,924
Let me write this out
again just so we have it.

300
00:17:28,16 --> 00:17:31,68
So it's x minus x cubed over
3 factorial plus x to the

301
00:17:31,68 --> 00:17:33,06
fifth over 5 factorial.


302
00:17:34,58 --> 00:17:37,65
You guessed it, and so on.


303
00:17:38,74 --> 00:17:40,51
That's the power series
expansion for the

304
00:17:40,51 --> 00:17:43,935
sine of x, OK?


305
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,95



306
00:17:46,95 --> 00:17:49,7
So, the sines alternate,
and these denominators

307
00:17:49,7 --> 00:17:51,7
get very big, don't they?


308
00:17:52,25 --> 00:17:54,02
Factorials grow very fast.


309
00:17:54,41 --> 00:17:55,375
Let me make a remark.


310
00:17:55,83 --> 00:17:57,55
r is infinity here.


311
00:17:58,8 --> 00:18:02,07
The radius of convergence of
this power series again is

312
00:18:02,07 --> 00:18:03,723
infinity, and let
me just say why.

313
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:11,01



314
00:18:11,01 --> 00:18:14,81
The general term is going to be
like x to the 2n plus 1 divided

315
00:18:14,81 --> 00:18:19,29
by 2n plus one factorial,
an odd number I can

316
00:18:19,29 --> 00:18:20,64
write as 2n plus 1.


317
00:18:21,9 --> 00:18:26,04
And what I want to say is about
what happens to the size of

318
00:18:26,04 --> 00:18:31,96
this as n goes to infinity.


319
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35,28
So let's just think about this.


320
00:18:35,28 --> 00:18:37,775
For a fixed x, let's
fix the number of x.

321
00:18:38,27 --> 00:18:41,57
Look at powers of x and think
about the size of this

322
00:18:41,57 --> 00:18:43,445
expression when n
gets to be large.

323
00:18:45,93 --> 00:18:47,14
Let's just do that
for a second.

324
00:18:47,14 --> 00:18:53,27
So, for x to the 2n plus 1
over 2n plus 1 factorial,

325
00:18:53,27 --> 00:18:54,42
I can write out like this.


326
00:18:54,42 --> 00:19:09,25
It's x over one times x over x
over 3, times x over 2n plus 1.

327
00:19:09,25 --> 00:19:13,22
I've multiplied x by itself 2n
plus 1 times in the numerator,

328
00:19:13,22 --> 00:19:16,85
and I've multiplied the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, by each

329
00:19:16,85 --> 00:19:19,81
other in the denominator, and
that gives me the factorial.

330
00:19:19,81 --> 00:19:21,57
So I've just written
this out like this.

331
00:19:22,33 --> 00:19:26,82
Now x is fixed, so maybe
it's a million, OK?

332
00:19:26,82 --> 00:19:28,275
It's big, but fixed.


333
00:19:28,7 --> 00:19:30,195
What happens to these numbers?


334
00:19:30,65 --> 00:19:32,05
Well at first,
they're pretty big.

335
00:19:32,05 --> 00:19:34,255
This is a million over 2,
this is a million over 3.

336
00:19:34,56 --> 00:19:39,14
But when n gets to be maybe
a million, then this

337
00:19:39,14 --> 00:19:39,98
is about one half.


338
00:19:41,18 --> 00:19:47,16
If n is a billion, then this
is about 1/2,000, right?

339
00:19:48,32 --> 00:19:50,53
The denominator just keep
getting bigger and bigger,

340
00:19:50,53 --> 00:19:53,48
but the numerators stay the
same; they're always x.

341
00:19:54,47 --> 00:19:57,875
So when I take the product, if
I go far enough out, I'm going

342
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,34
to be multiplying, by very,
very small numbers and

343
00:20:00,34 --> 00:20:01,415
more and more of them.


344
00:20:01,73 --> 00:20:05,98
And so no matter what
x is, these numbers

345
00:20:05,98 --> 00:20:07,22
will converge to 0.


346
00:20:07,22 --> 00:20:10,04
They'll get smaller and smaller
as x gets to be bigger.

347
00:20:11,55 --> 00:20:15,06
That's the sign that
x is inside of the

348
00:20:15,06 --> 00:20:16,1
radius of convergence.


349
00:20:16,59 --> 00:20:22,13
This is the sign for you
that this series converges

350
00:20:22,13 --> 00:20:23,145
for that value of x.


351
00:20:23,78 --> 00:20:31,61
And because I could do this
for any x, this works.

352
00:20:33,6 --> 00:20:39,78
This convergence to
0 for any fixed s.

353
00:20:40,26 --> 00:20:44,51
That's what tells you that
the raidus of convergence

354
00:20:44,51 --> 00:20:53,07
is infinity because of the
formula that the radius of

355
00:20:53,07 --> 00:20:54,295
convergence talks about.


356
00:20:54,57 --> 00:20:57,805
If r is equal infinity,
this is no condition on x.

357
00:20:58,16 --> 00:21:02,48
Every number is less than
infinity in absolute value, So

358
00:21:02,48 --> 00:21:06,59
if this covergence to 0 of
the general term works for

359
00:21:06,59 --> 00:21:08,895
every x, then radius of
convergence is infinity.

360
00:21:10,32 --> 00:21:12,33
Well that was kind of fast, but
I think that you've heard

361
00:21:12,33 --> 00:21:14,56
something about that
earlier as well.

362
00:21:16,02 --> 00:21:19,14
Anyway, so we've got the sine
function, a new function

363
00:21:19,14 --> 00:21:20,465
with its own power series.


364
00:21:20,88 --> 00:21:22,96
It's a way of
computing sine of x.

365
00:21:23,73 --> 00:21:27,99
If you take enough terms you'll
a good evaluation of the

366
00:21:27,99 --> 00:21:29,34
sine of x for any x.


367
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32,43
This tells you a lot about
the function sine of x but

368
00:21:32,43 --> 00:21:33,75
not everything at all.


369
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:37,85
For example, from this formula,
it's very hard to see that

370
00:21:37,85 --> 00:21:38,955
the sine of x is periodic.


371
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,485
I'ts not obvious at all.


372
00:21:41,93 --> 00:21:44,83
Somewhere hidden away in this
expression is that number

373
00:21:44,83 --> 00:21:46,726
pi, the half of the period.


374
00:21:47,4 --> 00:21:49,92
But that's not clear from
the power series at all.

375
00:21:51,1 --> 00:21:53,32
So the power series are
very good for some things,

376
00:21:53,32 --> 00:21:55,51
but they hide other
properties of functions.

377
00:21:55,51 --> 00:21:58,15



378
00:21:58,15 --> 00:22:02,07
So I want to spend a few
minutes telling you about what

379
00:22:02,07 --> 00:22:05,9
you can do with a power series
once you have one to get

380
00:22:05,9 --> 00:22:08,53
new power series, and new
power series from old.

381
00:22:08,53 --> 00:22:18,3



382
00:22:18,3 --> 00:22:24,56
This is also called
operations on power series.

383
00:22:25,49 --> 00:22:28,27
So what are the things that
we can do to a power series?

384
00:22:28,27 --> 00:22:29,905
Well one of the things
you can do is multiply.

385
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:33,99



386
00:22:33,99 --> 00:22:37,88
For example, what if I want to
compute a power series for

387
00:22:37,88 --> 00:22:39,42
x times the sine of x.


388
00:22:40,97 --> 00:22:43,905
Well I a power series for the
sine of x, I just did it.

389
00:22:44,16 --> 00:22:45,92
How about a power series for x?


390
00:22:45,92 --> 00:22:48,91



391
00:22:48,91 --> 00:22:50,545
Actually, I did that here too.


392
00:22:51,48 --> 00:22:54,65
The function x is a very
simple polynomial.

393
00:22:55,12 --> 00:22:58,93
It's a polynomial where, about
0, a1 is 1, and all the

394
00:22:58,93 --> 00:23:00,22
other coefficients are 0.


395
00:23:00,93 --> 00:23:04,09
So x itself is a power
series, a very simple one.

396
00:23:04,09 --> 00:23:06,67
The sine of x is
a powers series.

397
00:23:08,44 --> 00:23:11,06
What I want to encourage you
to do is treat power series

398
00:23:11,06 --> 00:23:13,905
just like polynomials and
multiply them together.

399
00:23:14,33 --> 00:23:16,64
We'll see other operations too.


400
00:23:16,96 --> 00:23:20,39
So, to compute the power series
for x times the sine of x, I

401
00:23:20,39 --> 00:23:23,5
just take this one and
multiply it by x.

402
00:23:23,5 --> 00:23:26,65



403
00:23:26,65 --> 00:23:31,04
It distributes through x
squared minus x to the fourth

404
00:23:31,04 --> 00:23:35,18
over 3 factorial plus
x to the sixth over 5

405
00:23:35,18 --> 00:23:40,39
factorial, and so on.


406
00:23:42,19 --> 00:23:44,68
Again, the radius of
convergence is going to be

407
00:23:44,68 --> 00:23:47,4
the smaller of the two
radii of convergence here.

408
00:23:48,22 --> 00:23:50,48
So it's r equals
infinity in this case.

409
00:23:51,84 --> 00:23:53,72
OK, you can multiply
power series together.

410
00:23:54,01 --> 00:23:57,8
It can be a pain if the power
series are very long, but

411
00:23:57,8 --> 00:23:59,66
if one of them is x,
it's pretty simple.

412
00:24:01,8 --> 00:24:03,72
OK, it's one thing I can do.


413
00:24:06,04 --> 00:24:07,22
Notice something by the way.


414
00:24:08,91 --> 00:24:10,175
You know that even
an odd functions?

415
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:13,18



416
00:24:13,18 --> 00:24:17,49
So, sine is an odd function, x
is an odd function, and the

417
00:24:17,49 --> 00:24:19,93
product of two large functions
is an even function.

418
00:24:20,57 --> 00:24:24,07
That's reflected in the fact
that all the powers that occur

419
00:24:24,07 --> 00:24:25,475
in the power series are even.


420
00:24:26,79 --> 00:24:30,37
For an odd function, like the
sine, all the powers that

421
00:24:30,37 --> 00:24:32,135
occur are odd powers of x.


422
00:24:32,6 --> 00:24:33,38
That's always true.


423
00:24:33,38 --> 00:24:37,51



424
00:24:37,51 --> 00:24:40,01
OK, we can multiply, and I
can also differentiate.

425
00:24:40,01 --> 00:24:48,66



426
00:24:48,66 --> 00:24:57,66
Let's just do a case of that
and use the process of

427
00:24:57,66 --> 00:25:00,41
differentiation to find out
what the power series for the

428
00:25:00,41 --> 00:25:05,23
cosine of x is by writing
the cosine of x as the

429
00:25:05,23 --> 00:25:08,685
derivative of the sine and
differentiating term by term.

430
00:25:09,01 --> 00:25:11,97
So, I'll take this expression
for the power series of the

431
00:25:11,97 --> 00:25:14,75
sine and differentiate it term
by term, and I'll get the

432
00:25:14,75 --> 00:25:16,61
power series for cosine.


433
00:25:18,21 --> 00:25:19,03
So, let's see.


434
00:25:19,03 --> 00:25:21,056
The derivative of x is one.


435
00:25:22,51 --> 00:25:26,37
The derivative of x cubed is 3x
squared, and then there's a 3

436
00:25:26,37 --> 00:25:27,66
factorial in the denominator.


437
00:25:28,91 --> 00:25:33,03
The derivative of x to the
fifth is 5x to the fourth, and

438
00:25:33,03 --> 00:25:35,83
there's a 5 factorial in the
denominator, and

439
00:25:35,83 --> 00:25:36,6
so on and so on.


440
00:25:38,68 --> 00:25:40,46
And know some
cancellation happens.

441
00:25:40,95 --> 00:25:45,96
So this is one minus, well, the
3 cancels with the last factor

442
00:25:45,96 --> 00:25:48,995
in this 3 factorial and
leaves you with 2 factorial.

443
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:52,46



444
00:25:52,46 --> 00:25:56,27
The 5 cancels with the last
factor in the 5 factorial and

445
00:25:56,27 --> 00:25:58,92
leaves you with a 4 factorial
in the denominator.

446
00:25:58,92 --> 00:26:01,57



447
00:26:01,57 --> 00:26:03,81
So, there you go, there's
the power series

448
00:26:03,81 --> 00:26:05,635
expansion for the cosine.


449
00:26:05,98 --> 00:26:09,76
It's got all even powers of x
they alternate, and you have

450
00:26:09,76 --> 00:26:11,34
factorials in the denominator.


451
00:26:12,72 --> 00:26:16,06
And of course, you could derive
that expression by using

452
00:26:16,06 --> 00:26:19,38
Taylor's formula by the same
kind of calculation you did

453
00:26:19,38 --> 00:26:22,71
here, taking higher and higher
derivatives of the cosine.

454
00:26:22,97 --> 00:26:26,52
You get the same periodic
pattern of derivatives and

455
00:26:26,52 --> 00:26:28,75
values of derivatives
at x equals 0.

456
00:26:30,08 --> 00:26:33,53
But here's a cleaner, simpler
way to do it because

457
00:26:33,53 --> 00:26:35,62
we already knew the
derivative of the sine.

458
00:26:36,83 --> 00:26:38,68
When you differentiate,
you keep the same

459
00:26:38,68 --> 00:26:39,63
radius of convergence.


460
00:26:39,63 --> 00:26:44,42



461
00:26:44,42 --> 00:26:50,06
OK, so we can multiply, and I
can add to and multiply that

462
00:26:50,06 --> 00:26:51,25
constant, things like that.


463
00:26:52,4 --> 00:26:53,28
How about integrating?


464
00:26:54,28 --> 00:26:56,58
That's what half of this
course was about isn't it?

465
00:26:56,58 --> 00:26:58,55
So, let's integrate something.


466
00:26:58,55 --> 00:27:07,21



467
00:27:07,21 --> 00:27:16,1
So, the integration I'm going
to do is this one: the

468
00:27:16,1 --> 00:27:19,31
integral from 0 to x
of dt over one plus x.

469
00:27:20,16 --> 00:27:21,98
What is that integral
as a function?

470
00:27:21,98 --> 00:27:28,36



471
00:27:28,36 --> 00:27:32,35
So, when I find the
anti-derivative of this, I get

472
00:27:32,35 --> 00:27:37,89
the natural log of 1 plus t,
and then when I evaluate that

473
00:27:37,89 --> 00:27:41,805
at t equals x, I get the
natural log of 1 plus x.

474
00:27:42,6 --> 00:27:47,41
And when I evaluate the natural
log at 0, I get the natural

475
00:27:47,41 --> 00:27:53,24
log of one, which is 0, so
this is what you get, OK?

476
00:27:55,07 --> 00:28:03,1
This is really valid, by
the way, for x bigger

477
00:28:03,1 --> 00:28:04,14
than minus one.


478
00:28:05,69 --> 00:28:09,06
But you don't want to think
about this quite like this

479
00:28:09,06 --> 00:28:10,24
when x is smaller than that.


480
00:28:10,24 --> 00:28:13,77



481
00:28:13,77 --> 00:28:19,94
Now, I'm going to try to apply
power series methods here and

482
00:28:19,94 --> 00:28:23,31
use this integral to find a
power series for the natural

483
00:28:23,31 --> 00:28:29,9
log, and I'll do it by plugging
in to this expression what the

484
00:28:29,9 --> 00:28:33,06
power series for
1/1 plus t was.

485
00:28:34,76 --> 00:28:36,5
I know what that is because
I wrote it down on

486
00:28:36,5 --> 00:28:37,33
the board up here.


487
00:28:38,33 --> 00:28:43,23
Change the variable from x to
t there, and so 1/1 plus t is

488
00:28:43,23 --> 00:28:49,41
1 minus t, plus t squared,
minust t cubed, and so on.

489
00:28:49,41 --> 00:28:52,62



490
00:28:52,62 --> 00:28:57,92
So that's the thing in the in
inside of the integral, and now

491
00:28:57,92 --> 00:29:02,62
it's legal to integrate that
term by term, so let's do that.

492
00:29:03,82 --> 00:29:05,35
I'm going to get something
which I will then

493
00:29:05,35 --> 00:29:07,74
evaluate at x and at 0.


494
00:29:09,23 --> 00:29:12,61
So, when I integrate one
I get x, and when they

495
00:29:12,61 --> 00:29:14,9
integrate t, I get t.


496
00:29:14,9 --> 00:29:19,15



497
00:29:19,15 --> 00:29:24,56
Intergrating t, I get t squared
over 2, and t squared gives me

498
00:29:24,56 --> 00:29:29,97
t cubed over 3, and
so on and so on.

499
00:29:29,97 --> 00:29:32,52



500
00:29:32,52 --> 00:29:37,36
Then, when I put in t equals x,
while I just replace all the

501
00:29:37,36 --> 00:29:41,1
t's by x's, and when I put
in t equals 0, I get 0.

502
00:29:41,78 --> 00:29:43,575
So this equals x.


503
00:29:43,95 --> 00:29:50,43
So, I've discovered that the
natural log of 1 plus x is x

504
00:29:50,43 --> 00:29:57,01
minus x squared over 2, plus x
cubed over 3 minus x to the

505
00:29:57,01 --> 00:30:00,188
fourth over 4, and
so on and so on.

506
00:30:02,02 --> 00:30:04,11
There's the power series
expansion for the natural

507
00:30:04,11 --> 00:30:05,18
log of 1 plus x.


508
00:30:05,18 --> 00:30:07,8



509
00:30:07,8 --> 00:30:11,06
Because I began with a power
series who's radius of

510
00:30:11,06 --> 00:30:15,57
convergence was just one, I
began with this power series,

511
00:30:15,57 --> 00:30:18,15
the radius of convergence of
this is also going to be one.

512
00:30:18,15 --> 00:30:22,2



513
00:30:22,2 --> 00:30:25,83
Also, because this function as
I just pointed out, this

514
00:30:25,83 --> 00:30:29,87
function goes bad when x
becomes less than minus one, so

515
00:30:29,87 --> 00:30:32,32
some problem happens, and
that's reflected in the

516
00:30:32,32 --> 00:30:33,17
radius of convergence.


517
00:30:35,59 --> 00:30:40,37
Cool, so, you can integrate.


518
00:30:41,11 --> 00:30:44,25
That is the correct power
series expansion for the

519
00:30:44,25 --> 00:30:48,06
natural log of 1 plus x, and
another victory of Euler's was

520
00:30:48,06 --> 00:30:50,85
to use this kind of power
series expansion to calculate

521
00:30:50,85 --> 00:30:53,28
natural algorithms in a much
more efficient way than

522
00:30:53,28 --> 00:30:54,35
people had done before.


523
00:30:54,35 --> 00:30:57,85



524
00:30:57,85 --> 00:31:17,482
OK, one more property, what
are we at here, 3 or 4?

525
00:31:18,69 --> 00:31:28,91
Substitute, very appropriate
for me as a substitute teacher

526
00:31:28,91 --> 00:31:29,96
to tell you about substitution.


527
00:31:29,96 --> 00:31:32,81



528
00:31:32,81 --> 00:31:35,48
So I'm going to try to find
the power series expansion

529
00:31:35,48 --> 00:31:36,885
of e to the minus t squared.


530
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:41,74



531
00:31:41,74 --> 00:31:45,19
And the way I'll do that is by
taking the power series

532
00:31:45,19 --> 00:31:50,74
expansion for e to the x, which
we have up there, and make the

533
00:31:50,74 --> 00:32:00,85
substitution x equals minus t
squared in the expansion

534
00:32:00,85 --> 00:32:01,63
for x to the x.


535
00:32:01,63 --> 00:32:02,32
Did you have a question?


536
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:05,66
AUDIENCE: Well, it's just
concerning the radius

537
00:32:05,66 --> 00:32:06,25
of convergence.


538
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:11,74
You can't define x so that is
always positive, and if so, it

539
00:32:11,74 --> 00:32:14,06
wouldn't have a radius
of convergence, right?

540
00:32:14,36 --> 00:32:19,37
PROFESSOR: Like I say, again
the worry is this natural log

541
00:32:19,37 --> 00:32:21,51
of 1 plus x function
is perfectly well

542
00:32:21,51 --> 00:32:22,76
behaved for large x.


543
00:32:24,12 --> 00:32:27,32
Why does the power series fail
to converge for large x?

544
00:32:27,72 --> 00:32:31,11
Well suppose that x is bigger
than one, then here you get

545
00:32:31,11 --> 00:32:35,16
bigger and bigger powers of x,
which will grow to infinity,

546
00:32:35,16 --> 00:32:40,23
and they grow large faster than
the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

547
00:32:40,33 --> 00:32:45,23
They grow exponentially, and
these just grow linearly.

548
00:32:45,85 --> 00:32:50,32
So, again, when x is bigger
than one, the general term will

549
00:32:50,32 --> 00:32:53,12
go off to infinity, even though
the function that you're

550
00:32:53,12 --> 00:32:56,39
talking about, log of net of 1
plus x is perfectly good.

551
00:32:56,75 --> 00:33:01,52
So the power series is
not good outside of the

552
00:33:01,52 --> 00:33:02,24
radius of convergence.


553
00:33:02,24 --> 00:33:03,55
It's just a fact of life.


554
00:33:04,72 --> 00:33:05,15
Yes?


555
00:33:05,15 --> 00:33:18,49
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


556
00:33:18,49 --> 00:33:19,61
PROFESSOR: Talk to
me after class.

557
00:33:20,29 --> 00:33:22,62
The question is why is it
the smaller of the two

558
00:33:22,62 --> 00:33:23,465
radii of convergence?


559
00:33:24,11 --> 00:33:31,13
The basic answer is, well, you
can't expect it to be bigger

560
00:33:31,13 --> 00:33:34,22
than that smaller one, because
the power series only gives you

561
00:33:34,22 --> 00:33:37,45
information inside of that
range about the function, so.

562
00:33:37,45 --> 00:33:41,01
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


563
00:33:41,01 --> 00:33:43,58
PROFESSOR: Well, in this
case, both of the radii of

564
00:33:43,58 --> 00:33:44,635
convergence are infinity.


565
00:33:44,89 --> 00:33:48,33
x has radius of convergence
infinity for sure, and

566
00:33:48,33 --> 00:33:49,26
sine of x does too.


567
00:33:49,26 --> 00:33:52,14
So you get insanity
in that case, OK?

568
00:33:52,14 --> 00:33:54,85



569
00:33:54,85 --> 00:33:59,42
Let's just do this, and then
I'm going to integrate this and

570
00:33:59,42 --> 00:34:01,785
that'll be the end of what
I have time for today.

571
00:34:03,83 --> 00:34:05,88
What's the power series
expansion for this?

572
00:34:05,88 --> 00:34:08,77
The power series expansion of
this is going to be a function

573
00:34:08,77 --> 00:34:12,634
of t, right, because
the variable here is t.

574
00:34:13,53 --> 00:34:17,37
I get it by taking my expansion
for x to the x and putting

575
00:34:17,37 --> 00:34:20,46
in what x is in terms of t.


576
00:34:20,46 --> 00:34:36,7



577
00:34:36,7 --> 00:34:40,95
I just put in minus t squared
in place of x there in the

578
00:34:40,95 --> 00:34:43,02
series expansion
for e to the x.

579
00:34:44,12 --> 00:34:46,583
I can work this out a
little bit better.

580
00:34:47,37 --> 00:34:49,03
minus t squared is what it is.


581
00:34:49,03 --> 00:34:52,95
This is going to give me a t
to the fourth and the minus

582
00:34:52,95 --> 00:34:55,47
squared is going to give me
a plus, so I get t to the

583
00:34:55,47 --> 00:34:56,879
fourth over 2 factorial.


584
00:34:58,73 --> 00:35:03,52
Then I get minus t quantity
cubed, so there'll be a minus

585
00:35:03,52 --> 00:35:07,383
sign and a t to the sixth and
the denominator 3 factorial.

586
00:35:08,19 --> 00:35:11,36
So the signs are going to
alternate, the powers are all

587
00:35:11,36 --> 00:35:15,38
even, and the denominators
are these factorials.

588
00:35:15,38 --> 00:35:20,16



589
00:35:20,16 --> 00:35:25,65
Several times as this course
has gone on, the error function

590
00:35:25,65 --> 00:35:26,813
has made an appearance.


591
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:35,72
The error function gets
normalized by putting a 2 over

592
00:35:35,72 --> 00:35:43,09
the square root of pi in front,
and it's the integral of e to

593
00:35:43,09 --> 00:35:46,27
the minus t squared
d t from 0 to x.

594
00:35:46,83 --> 00:35:55,24
This normalization is here
because as x gets to the

595
00:35:55,24 --> 00:36:00,84
large the value becomes one.


596
00:36:01,3 --> 00:36:04,17
So this error function is
very important in the

597
00:36:04,17 --> 00:36:04,86
theory of probability.


598
00:36:06,08 --> 00:36:08,54
I think you calculated
this fact at some

599
00:36:08,54 --> 00:36:09,76
point in the course.


600
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,59
This is the standard definition
of the error function, you

601
00:36:14,59 --> 00:36:16,46
put a 2 over the square
root of pi in front.

602
00:36:16,46 --> 00:36:18,425
Let's calculate it's
power series expansion.

603
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:21,32



604
00:36:21,32 --> 00:36:23,56
So there's a 2 over the
score root of pi that hurts

605
00:36:23,56 --> 00:36:26,56
nobody here in the front.


606
00:36:27,28 --> 00:36:30,74
And now I want to integrate
either the minus t squared, and

607
00:36:30,74 --> 00:36:34,01
I'm going to use this power
series expansion for that

608
00:36:34,01 --> 00:36:35,19
to see what you get.


609
00:36:36,35 --> 00:36:38,04
I'm just going to write
this out I think.

610
00:36:38,8 --> 00:36:40,98
I did it out carefully
in another example over

611
00:36:40,98 --> 00:36:42,775
there so I'll do it a
little quicker now.

612
00:36:43,1 --> 00:36:46,69
intergrate this terms by term,
you're just integrating powers

613
00:36:46,69 --> 00:36:50,73
of t so it's pretty simple, and
then I'm evaluating

614
00:36:50,73 --> 00:36:51,83
at and then 0.


615
00:36:51,83 --> 00:37:01,24
So I get x minus x cubed over
3, plus x to the fifth over 5

616
00:37:01,24 --> 00:37:05,82
times 2 factorial, 5 from
integrating the t's of the

617
00:37:05,82 --> 00:37:08,82
fourth, and the 2 factorial
from this denominator

618
00:37:08,82 --> 00:37:09,75
that we already had.


619
00:37:11,39 --> 00:37:15,84
And then there's an a minus x
to the seventh over 7 times 3

620
00:37:15,84 --> 00:37:20,07
factorial, and plus, and so
on, and you can imagine

621
00:37:20,07 --> 00:37:21,62
how they go on from there.


622
00:37:21,62 --> 00:37:24,49



623
00:37:24,49 --> 00:37:29,05
I guess to get this exactly
in the form that we began

624
00:37:29,05 --> 00:37:32,51
talking about, I should
multiply through.

625
00:37:32,51 --> 00:37:35,93
So the coeifficient of x is 2
over the square root of pi, and

626
00:37:35,93 --> 00:37:39,36
the coefficient of x cubed is
minus 2/3 times the square

627
00:37:39,36 --> 00:37:40,47
root of pi, and so on.


628
00:37:41,09 --> 00:37:43,14
But this is a perfectly good
way to write this power

629
00:37:43,14 --> 00:37:44,51
series expansion as well.


630
00:37:45,63 --> 00:37:48,42
And, this is a very good
way to compute the value

631
00:37:48,42 --> 00:37:49,295
of the error function.


632
00:37:49,57 --> 00:37:52,82
It's a new function
in our experience.

633
00:37:53,21 --> 00:37:56,05
Your calculator probably
calculates it, and your

634
00:37:56,05 --> 00:37:58,71
calculator probably does
it by this method.

635
00:37:58,71 --> 00:38:01,27



636
00:38:01,27 --> 00:38:07,68
OK, so that's my sermon on
examples of things you can

637
00:38:07,68 --> 00:38:08,8
do with power series.


638
00:38:10,26 --> 00:38:13,43
So, we're going to do the
CEG thing in just a minute.

639
00:38:13,87 --> 00:38:17,16
Professor Jerison wanted me
to make an ad for 18.02.

640
00:38:17,74 --> 00:38:20,62
Just in case you were thinking
of not taking it next term,

641
00:38:20,62 --> 00:38:21,98
you really should take it.


642
00:38:21,98 --> 00:38:25,07
It will put a lot of things
in this course into

643
00:38:25,07 --> 00:38:26,46
context, for one thing.


644
00:38:26,72 --> 00:38:29,03
It's about vector
calculus and so on.

645
00:38:29,03 --> 00:38:31,21
So you'll learn about vectors
and things like that.

646
00:38:32,19 --> 00:38:35,59
But it comes back and explains
some things in this course that

647
00:38:35,59 --> 00:38:38,15
might have been a little bit
strange, like these strange

648
00:38:38,15 --> 00:38:46,08
formulas for the product rule
and the quotient rule and these

649
00:38:46,08 --> 00:38:47,255
sort of random formulas.


650
00:38:48,71 --> 00:38:51,1
Well, one of the things you
learn in 18.02 is that

651
00:38:51,1 --> 00:38:54,185
they're all special
cases of the chain rule.

652
00:38:54,56 --> 00:38:59,39
And just to drive that point
home, he wanted me to show you

653
00:38:59,39 --> 00:39:04,47
this poem of his that really
drives the points home

654
00:39:04,47 --> 00:39:04,75
forcefully, I think.


655
00:39:04,75 --> 00:39:13,22
