8
00:00:21,51 --> 00:00:24,84
PROFESSOR: Last time we left
off with a question having to

9
00:00:24,84 --> 00:00:26,185
do with playing with blocks.


10
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:30,45
And this is supposed to give us
a visceral feel for something

11
00:00:30,45 --> 00:00:31,705
anyway, having to
do with series.

12
00:00:32,82 --> 00:00:36,06
And the question was whether I
could stack these blocks, build

13
00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:39,46
up a stack so that I'm
going to try here up.

14
00:00:39,46 --> 00:00:42,56
I'm already off
balance here, see.

15
00:00:42,92 --> 00:00:48,75
The question is can I build
this so that the-- let's draw

16
00:00:48,75 --> 00:00:54,46
a picture of it so that the
first block is like this.

17
00:00:54,87 --> 00:00:56,335
The next block is like this.


18
00:00:56,8 --> 00:00:58,15
And maybe the next
block is like this.

19
00:00:58,15 --> 00:01:00,34
And notice there is
no visible means of

20
00:01:00,34 --> 00:01:02,41
support for this block.


21
00:01:02,41 --> 00:01:06,54
It's completely to the
left of the first block.

22
00:01:08,31 --> 00:01:11,055
And the question is,
will this fall down?

23
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:13,73



24
00:01:13,73 --> 00:01:21,69
Or at least, or more precisely,
eventually we'll ask you

25
00:01:21,69 --> 00:01:23,58
know, how far can we go?


26
00:01:24,65 --> 00:01:30,05
Now before you answer this
question, the claim is it that

27
00:01:30,05 --> 00:01:33,48
this is a kind of a natural,
physical question, which

28
00:01:33,48 --> 00:01:37,04
involves some important answer.


29
00:01:37,33 --> 00:01:40,29
No matter whether the answer
is, you can do it or you can't.

30
00:01:40,29 --> 00:01:43,08
So this is a good kind of math
question where no matter what

31
00:01:43,08 --> 00:01:45,39
the answer is, when you figure
out the answer, you're

32
00:01:45,39 --> 00:01:47,35
going to get something
interesting out of it.

33
00:01:47,35 --> 00:01:48,235
Because they're two
possibilities.

34
00:01:48,57 --> 00:01:53,49
Either there is a limit to how
far to the left we can go-- in

35
00:01:53,49 --> 00:01:56,7
which case that's a very
interesting number-- or

36
00:01:56,7 --> 00:01:58,81
else there is no limit.


37
00:01:58,81 --> 00:02:00,37
You can go arbitrarily far.


38
00:02:00,37 --> 00:02:02,83
And that's also
interesting and curious.

39
00:02:03,24 --> 00:02:05,54
And that's the difference
between convergence and

40
00:02:05,54 --> 00:02:09,28
divergence, the thing that
we were talking about up

41
00:02:09,28 --> 00:02:10,994
to now concerning series.


42
00:02:11,38 --> 00:02:18,12
So my first question is, do you
think that I can get it so that

43
00:02:18,12 --> 00:02:22,41
this thing doesn't fall down
with, well you see I have about

44
00:02:22,41 --> 00:02:23,71
eight blocks here or so.


45
00:02:24,02 --> 00:02:25,57
So you can vote now.


46
00:02:25,57 --> 00:02:28,55
How many in favor that I can
succeed in doing this sort of

47
00:02:28,55 --> 00:02:30,45
thing with maybe more
than three blocks.

48
00:02:30,45 --> 00:02:31,36
How many in favor?


49
00:02:32,04 --> 00:02:33,595
All right somebody
is voting twice.

50
00:02:33,86 --> 00:02:34,56
That's good.


51
00:02:34,56 --> 00:02:35,15
I like that.


52
00:02:35,98 --> 00:02:37,005
How about opposed?


53
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,93



54
00:02:39,93 --> 00:02:43,035
So that was really
close to a tie.

55
00:02:43,45 --> 00:02:43,836
All right.


56
00:02:44,78 --> 00:02:46,965
But I think the there was
slightly more opposed.

57
00:02:49,22 --> 00:02:49,57
I don't know.


58
00:02:49,57 --> 00:02:51,53
You guys who are in the
back maybe could tell.

59
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53,475
Anyway it was pretty close.


60
00:02:53,81 --> 00:02:54,25
All right.


61
00:02:54,25 --> 00:02:57,43
So now I'm going-- because this
is a real life thing-- I'm

62
00:02:57,43 --> 00:02:58,2
going to try to do it.


63
00:02:58,2 --> 00:02:58,475
All right?


64
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:00,195
All right.


65
00:03:00,55 --> 00:03:02,77
So now I'm going to tell
you what the trick is.

66
00:03:04,24 --> 00:03:08,565
The trick is to
do it backwards.

67
00:03:08,89 --> 00:03:12,12
When most people are playing
with blocks, they decide to

68
00:03:12,12 --> 00:03:14,125
build it from the bottom up.


69
00:03:14,42 --> 00:03:14,71
Right?


70
00:03:15,67 --> 00:03:19,28
But we're going to build
it from the top down,

71
00:03:19,28 --> 00:03:20,375
from the top down.


72
00:03:20,76 --> 00:03:22,82
And that's going to make it
possible for us to do the

73
00:03:22,82 --> 00:03:24,26
optimal thing at each stage.


74
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:28,4
So when I build it from the
top down, the best I can do

75
00:03:28,4 --> 00:03:30,29
is well, it'll fall off.


76
00:03:30,52 --> 00:03:33,745
I need to have it you
know, halfway across.

77
00:03:34,04 --> 00:03:35,215
That's the best I can do.


78
00:03:35,47 --> 00:03:37,62
So the top one I'm going
to build like that.

79
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40,75
I'm going to take it as
far to the left as I can.

80
00:03:41,73 --> 00:03:44,45
And then I'm going to put
the next one down as far

81
00:03:44,45 --> 00:03:45,46
to the left as I can.


82
00:03:46,16 --> 00:03:49,57
And then the next one as
far to the left as I can.

83
00:03:50,45 --> 00:03:51,4
That was a little too far.


84
00:03:51,74 --> 00:03:54,78
And then I'm going to
do the next one as far

85
00:03:54,78 --> 00:03:55,956
to the left as I can.


86
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,99
And then I'm going to do the
next one-- well let's line it

87
00:03:58,99 --> 00:04:03,57
up first-- as far to
the left as I can.

88
00:04:04,45 --> 00:04:04,8
OK?


89
00:04:05,15 --> 00:04:08,574
And then the next one as
far to the left as I can.

90
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:09,92
All right.


91
00:04:09,92 --> 00:04:15,23
Now those of you who are
in this line can see,

92
00:04:15,23 --> 00:04:16,209
all right, I succeeded.


93
00:04:16,65 --> 00:04:18,74
All right, that's
over the edge.

94
00:04:18,74 --> 00:04:19,376
All right?


95
00:04:20,05 --> 00:04:21,16
So it can be done.


96
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:22,39
All right.


97
00:04:22,39 --> 00:04:25,45



98
00:04:25,45 --> 00:04:25,91
All right.


99
00:04:26,59 --> 00:04:32,75
So now we know that we can
get farther than you know,

100
00:04:32,75 --> 00:04:34,26
we can make it overflow.


101
00:04:34,5 --> 00:04:36,57
So the question now is,
how far can I get?

102
00:04:37,39 --> 00:04:37,815
OK.


103
00:04:38,24 --> 00:04:39,79
Do you think I can get to here?


104
00:04:40,63 --> 00:04:43,26
Can I get to the end over here?


105
00:04:43,26 --> 00:04:49,43
So how many people think I can
get this far over to here?

106
00:04:50,17 --> 00:04:51,73
How many people think
I can get this far?

107
00:04:51,73 --> 00:04:53,11
Well you know, remember.


108
00:04:53,39 --> 00:04:55,92
I'm going to have to use more
than just this one more

109
00:04:55,92 --> 00:04:56,68
block that I've got.


110
00:04:58,03 --> 00:04:58,28
Right?


111
00:04:58,28 --> 00:05:01,19
Obviously I'm thinking,
actually I do have some

112
00:05:01,19 --> 00:05:02,005
more blocks at home.


113
00:05:02,33 --> 00:05:03,37
But, OK.


114
00:05:03,37 --> 00:05:04,085
We're not going to.


115
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,07
But anyway, do you think
I can get over to here?

116
00:05:06,51 --> 00:05:07,7
How many people say yes?


117
00:05:09,71 --> 00:05:11,36
And how many people say no?


118
00:05:13,06 --> 00:05:15,37
More people said no then yes.


119
00:05:15,37 --> 00:05:15,68
All right.


120
00:05:15,68 --> 00:05:18,16
So maybe the stopping
place is some mysterious

121
00:05:18,16 --> 00:05:19,63
number in between here.


122
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:20,69
All right?


123
00:05:20,69 --> 00:05:21,72
Well OK.


124
00:05:21,72 --> 00:05:24,47
So now we're going to
do the arithmetic.

125
00:05:24,84 --> 00:05:28,27
And we're going to figure out
what happens with this problem.

126
00:05:28,87 --> 00:05:29,185
OK?


127
00:05:29,5 --> 00:05:30,75
So let's do it.


128
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:36,78
All right, so now again the
idea is, the idea is we're

129
00:05:36,78 --> 00:05:44,21
going to start with the
top, the top block.

130
00:05:44,21 --> 00:05:46,71



131
00:05:46,71 --> 00:05:48,45
We'll call that
block number one.

132
00:05:48,45 --> 00:05:53,07



133
00:05:53,07 --> 00:05:56,62
And then the farthest if you
like to the right, that you

134
00:05:56,62 --> 00:05:59,07
can put a block underneath
it, is exactly halfway.

135
00:05:59,07 --> 00:06:01,8



136
00:06:01,8 --> 00:06:04,61
All right well, that's
the best job I can do.

137
00:06:04,61 --> 00:06:08,8
Now in order to make my units
work out easily, I'm going

138
00:06:08,8 --> 00:06:12,47
to decide to call the
length of the block 2.

139
00:06:13,16 --> 00:06:13,625
All right?


140
00:06:14,09 --> 00:06:17,33
And that means if I start
at location 0, then the

141
00:06:17,33 --> 00:06:20,88
first place where I am is
supposed to be halfway.

142
00:06:22,55 --> 00:06:24,07
And that will be 1.


143
00:06:24,07 --> 00:06:26,65



144
00:06:26,65 --> 00:06:31,66
OK so the first step in the
process is 1 more to the right.

145
00:06:31,66 --> 00:06:34,1
Or if you like, if I were
building up-- which is what you

146
00:06:34,1 --> 00:06:35,9
would actually have to do in
real life-- it would

147
00:06:35,9 --> 00:06:36,91
be 1 to the left.


148
00:06:39,28 --> 00:06:40,695
OK now the next one.


149
00:06:41,61 --> 00:06:44,74
Now here is the way that
you start figuring

150
00:06:44,74 --> 00:06:45,46
out the arithmetic.


151
00:06:45,46 --> 00:06:47,51
The next one is based on
a physical principle.

152
00:06:48,19 --> 00:06:53,35
Which is that the farthest I
can stick this next block

153
00:06:53,35 --> 00:06:57,95
underneath is what's called the
center of mass of these two,

154
00:06:57,95 --> 00:07:00,21
which is exactly halfway here.


155
00:07:00,21 --> 00:07:02,715
That is there's 1/4 of this
guy, and a 1/4 of that

156
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,225
guy balancing each other.


157
00:07:04,66 --> 00:07:04,9
Right?


158
00:07:04,9 --> 00:07:06,16
So that's as far as I can go.


159
00:07:06,16 --> 00:07:08,18
If I go farther than
that, it'll fall over.

160
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,6
So that's the absolute
farthest I can do.

161
00:07:10,6 --> 00:07:13,93
So the next block is
going to be over here.

162
00:07:14,63 --> 00:07:17,775
And 1/4 of 2 is 1/2.


163
00:07:18,21 --> 00:07:20,88
So this is 3/2 here.


164
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,656
All right so we went to 1.


165
00:07:24,43 --> 00:07:27,63
We went to it 3/2 here.


166
00:07:27,96 --> 00:07:31
And then I'm going to keep on
going with this eventually.

167
00:07:31,3 --> 00:07:34,6
All right so we're going to
figure out what happens

168
00:07:34,6 --> 00:07:35,18
with this stack.


169
00:07:36,77 --> 00:07:37,045
Question?


170
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:40,72
AUDIENCE: How do you know
that this is the best

171
00:07:40,72 --> 00:07:41,516
way to optimize?


172
00:07:42,67 --> 00:07:44,575
PROFESSOR: The question is
how do I know that this is

173
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:45,32
the best way to optimize?


174
00:07:46,87 --> 00:07:48,775
I can't answer that question.


175
00:07:49,21 --> 00:07:51,43
But I can tell you that it's
the best way if I start

176
00:07:51,43 --> 00:07:53,86
with a top like this, and
the next one like this.

177
00:07:53,86 --> 00:07:56,59
Right, because I'm doing
the farthest possible

178
00:07:56,59 --> 00:07:57,155
at each stage.


179
00:07:57,47 --> 00:07:59,84
That actually has a name in
computer science that's

180
00:07:59,84 --> 00:08:01,145
called the greedy algorithm.


181
00:08:01,61 --> 00:08:03,815
I'm trying to do the best
possible at each stage.

182
00:08:04,52 --> 00:08:07,31
The greedy algorithm starting
from the bottom, is an

183
00:08:07,31 --> 00:08:08,695
extremely bad strategy.


184
00:08:09,42 --> 00:08:12,79
Because when you do that,
you stack it this way,

185
00:08:12,79 --> 00:08:14,12
and it almost falls over.


186
00:08:14,12 --> 00:08:15,56
And then the next time
you can't do anything.

187
00:08:16,05 --> 00:08:18,205
So the greedy algorithm is
terrible from the bottom.

188
00:08:19,03 --> 00:08:21,85
This is the greedy algorithm
starting from the top, and it

189
00:08:21,85 --> 00:08:24,72
turns out to do much better
then the greedy algorithm

190
00:08:24,72 --> 00:08:25,58
starting from the bottom.


191
00:08:25,58 --> 00:08:27,39
But of course I'm not
addressing whether there might

192
00:08:27,39 --> 00:08:30,42
not be some other incredibly
clever strategy where I wiggle

193
00:08:30,42 --> 00:08:33
around and make it go up.


194
00:08:34,26 --> 00:08:36,01
I'm not addressing
that question.

195
00:08:36,13 --> 00:08:37,65
It turns out this is
the best you can do.

196
00:08:37,65 --> 00:08:39,66
But that's not clear.


197
00:08:40,79 --> 00:08:44,65
All right so now, here
we have this thing.

198
00:08:44,65 --> 00:08:47,6
And now I have to figure out
what the arithmetic pattern is,

199
00:08:47,6 --> 00:08:50,34
so that I can figure out what I
was doing with those shapes.

200
00:08:50,34 --> 00:08:53,85



201
00:08:53,85 --> 00:08:58,132
So let's figure out a
thought experiment here.

202
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,08
All right?


203
00:08:59,57 --> 00:09:03,04
Now the thought experiment I
want to imagine for you is,

204
00:09:03,04 --> 00:09:08,45
you've got a stack of a bunch
of blocks, and this is

205
00:09:08,45 --> 00:09:10,07
the first N blocks.


206
00:09:10,07 --> 00:09:14,15



207
00:09:14,15 --> 00:09:14,64
All right?


208
00:09:15,31 --> 00:09:17,55
And now we're going to
put one underneath it.

209
00:09:19,01 --> 00:09:25,23
And what we're going to figure
out is the center of mass of

210
00:09:25,23 --> 00:09:27,55
those N blocks, which I'm
going to call C sub N.

211
00:09:29,06 --> 00:09:29,56
OK.


212
00:09:30,96 --> 00:09:33,09
And that's the place where
I'm going to put this

213
00:09:33,09 --> 00:09:34,32
very next block.


214
00:09:34,32 --> 00:09:36,105
I'll put it in a
different color here.

215
00:09:36,48 --> 00:09:38,935
Here's the new,
next block over.

216
00:09:39,56 --> 00:09:42,36
And the next block over
is the N plus 1st block.

217
00:09:42,36 --> 00:09:49,9



218
00:09:49,9 --> 00:09:54,38
And now I want you to think
about what's going on here.

219
00:09:54,38 --> 00:09:58,15
If the center of mass of the
first N blocks is this number,

220
00:09:58,15 --> 00:10:00,71
this new one, it's of length 2.


221
00:10:01,7 --> 00:10:05,46
And its center of mass is
1 further to the right

222
00:10:05,46 --> 00:10:07,23
than the center of mass
that we had before.

223
00:10:07,85 --> 00:10:10,58
So in other words, I've added
to this configuration of N

224
00:10:10,58 --> 00:10:12,88
blocks, 1 more block,
which is shifted.

225
00:10:13,22 --> 00:10:16,56
Whose center mass is not lined
up with the center of mass of

226
00:10:16,56 --> 00:10:19,84
this, but actually over
farther to the right.

227
00:10:20,2 --> 00:10:25,378
All right so the new center of
mass of this new block-- and

228
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:27,56
this is the extra piece of
information that I want to

229
00:10:27,56 --> 00:10:32,94
observe-- is that this thing
has a center of mass

230
00:10:32,94 --> 00:10:36,355
at C sub N plus 1.


231
00:10:36,74 --> 00:10:39,43
It's 1 unit over because
this total length is 2.

232
00:10:39,87 --> 00:10:44,28
So right in the middle there is
1 over, according to my units.

233
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,58
All right now this is going to
make it possible for me to

234
00:10:48,58 --> 00:10:50,89
figure out what the new
center of mass is.

235
00:10:51,97 --> 00:11:02,485
So C sub N plus 1 is the center
of mass of N plus 1 blocks.

236
00:11:04,86 --> 00:11:08,53
Now this is really only in the
horizontal variable, right?

237
00:11:08,91 --> 00:11:10,535
I'm not keeping track
of the center of mass.

238
00:11:10,86 --> 00:11:12,94
Actually this thing is hard
to build because the center

239
00:11:12,94 --> 00:11:13,86
of mass is also rising.


240
00:11:14,24 --> 00:11:15,83
It's getting higher and higher.


241
00:11:15,83 --> 00:11:18,5
But I'm only keeping track
of its left and right

242
00:11:18,5 --> 00:11:18,836
characteristic.


243
00:11:19,51 --> 00:11:21,59
So this is the
x-coordinate of it.

244
00:11:21,59 --> 00:11:27,76



245
00:11:27,76 --> 00:11:29,13
All right so now
here's the idea.

246
00:11:31,59 --> 00:11:35,62
I'm combining the white ones,
the N blocks, with the

247
00:11:35,62 --> 00:11:37,335
pink one, which is the
one on the bottom.

248
00:11:37,63 --> 00:11:41,02
And there are N of
the white ones.

249
00:11:41,02 --> 00:11:42,52
And there's 1 of the pink one.


250
00:11:42,52 --> 00:11:44,44
And so in order to get the
center of mass of the whole,

251
00:11:44,44 --> 00:11:46,86
I have to take the weighted
average of the two.

252
00:11:47,7 --> 00:11:55,48
That's N times C sub N plus 1,
times the center of mass of the

253
00:11:55,48 --> 00:11:58,11
pink one, which is
C sub N plus 1.

254
00:12:00,27 --> 00:12:02,095
And then I have to divide if
it's the weighted average of

255
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:05,19
the total of N plus 1
blocks, by N plus 1.

256
00:12:06,56 --> 00:12:09,44
This is going to give me the
new center of mass of my

257
00:12:09,44 --> 00:12:11,855
configuration at the
N plus 1st stage.

258
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,8



259
00:12:14,8 --> 00:12:16,66
And now I can just do the
arithmetic and figure

260
00:12:16,66 --> 00:12:17,49
out what this is.


261
00:12:19,34 --> 00:12:21,335
And the two C sub Ns combine.


262
00:12:21,81 --> 00:12:28,26
I get N plus 1, times C sub N
plus 1, divided by N plus 1.

263
00:12:30,25 --> 00:12:33,68
And if I combine these two
things and do the cancellation,

264
00:12:33,68 --> 00:12:37,045
that gives me this recurrence
formula, C sub N plus 1 is

265
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:40,635
equal to C sub N plus,
there's a little extra.

266
00:12:41,04 --> 00:12:41,75
These two cancel.


267
00:12:42,01 --> 00:12:43,125
That gives me the C sub N.


268
00:12:43,38 --> 00:12:46,74
But then I also have
1 over N plus 1.

269
00:12:46,74 --> 00:12:54,23



270
00:12:54,23 --> 00:12:57,27
Well that's how much gain I
can get in the center of mass

271
00:12:57,27 --> 00:12:58,62
by adding one more block.


272
00:12:58,62 --> 00:13:02,27
That's how much I can shift
things over, depending on how

273
00:13:02,27 --> 00:13:05,51
we're thinking of things to the
left or the right, depending on

274
00:13:05,51 --> 00:13:07,137
which direction we're
building them.

275
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:10,96



276
00:13:10,96 --> 00:13:13,84
All right, so now I'm going
to work out the formulas.

277
00:13:13,84 --> 00:13:17,345
First of all C sub 1, that was
the center of the first block.

278
00:13:17,68 --> 00:13:19,92
I put its left-ended
0, the center of the

279
00:13:19,92 --> 00:13:21,24
first block is at 1.


280
00:13:22,25 --> 00:13:23,7
That mean that C sub 1 is 1.


281
00:13:25,91 --> 00:13:26,225
OK?


282
00:13:27,31 --> 00:13:31,09
C sub 2, according to this
formula-- and actually I've

283
00:13:31,09 --> 00:13:32,99
worked it out, we'll check
it in this thing-- C sub 2

284
00:13:32,99 --> 00:13:34,71
is C sub 1 plus 1 over 2.


285
00:13:35,53 --> 00:13:37,105
All right, so that's
the case, N equals 1.

286
00:13:37,38 --> 00:13:38,84
So this is 1 plus 1/2.


287
00:13:40,13 --> 00:13:41,15
That's what we already did.


288
00:13:43,42 --> 00:13:44,96
That's the 3/2 number.


289
00:13:45,79 --> 00:13:49,955
Now the next one is
C sub 2 plus 1/3.

290
00:13:51,32 --> 00:13:52,43
That's the formula again.


291
00:13:53,53 --> 00:13:57,205
And so that comes out to
be 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3.

292
00:13:59,59 --> 00:14:01,94
And now you can see
what the pattern is.

293
00:14:02,74 --> 00:14:07,84
C sub N, if you just keep on
going here, C sub N is going

294
00:14:07,84 --> 00:14:14,79
to be 1 plus 1/2 plus
1/3 plus 1/4 plus 1/N.

295
00:14:14,79 --> 00:14:21,41



296
00:14:21,41 --> 00:14:24,47
So now I would like
you to vote again.

297
00:14:25,6 --> 00:14:27,94
Do you think I can-- now that
we have the formula-- do you

298
00:14:27,94 --> 00:14:29
think I can get over to here?


299
00:14:30,83 --> 00:14:33,18
How many people think I
can get over to here?

300
00:14:33,18 --> 00:14:36,16



301
00:14:36,16 --> 00:14:38,84
How many people think I
can't get over to here?

302
00:14:40,41 --> 00:14:42,7
There's still a lot
of people who do.

303
00:14:42,7 --> 00:14:45,32
So it's still almost 50/50.


304
00:14:46,42 --> 00:14:47,14
That's amazing.


305
00:14:47,47 --> 00:14:49,8
Well so we'll address
that in a few minutes.

306
00:14:49,8 --> 00:14:51,49
So now let me tell
you what's going on.

307
00:14:52,69 --> 00:14:54,8
This C sub N of course,
is the same as what we

308
00:14:54,8 --> 00:14:56,39
called last time S sub N.


309
00:14:57,53 --> 00:15:01,23
And remember that we actually
estimated the size of this guy.

310
00:15:01,23 --> 00:15:03,34
This is related to what's
called the harmonic series.

311
00:15:04,62 --> 00:15:10,3
And what we showed is that log
N is less than S sub N, which

312
00:15:10,3 --> 00:15:13,64
is less than S sub N plus 1.


313
00:15:14,69 --> 00:15:15,335
All right?


314
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:17,91



315
00:15:17,91 --> 00:15:23,15
Now I'm going to call your
attention to the red part,

316
00:15:23,15 --> 00:15:26,71
which is the divergence part
of this estimate, which is

317
00:15:26,71 --> 00:15:29,23
this one for the time
being, all right.

318
00:15:30,29 --> 00:15:31,83
Just saying that this
thing is growing.

319
00:15:32,78 --> 00:15:42,57
And what this is saying is that
as N goes to infinite, log N

320
00:15:42,57 --> 00:15:52,23
goes to infinite, So that means
that S sub N goes to

321
00:15:52,23 --> 00:15:57,6
infinite, because of
this inequality here.

322
00:15:57,98 --> 00:15:59,473
It's bigger than log N.


323
00:16:00,3 --> 00:16:03,25
And so if N is big enough, we
can get as far as we like.

324
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:04,85
All right?


325
00:16:06,03 --> 00:16:08,045
So I can get to here.


326
00:16:08,53 --> 00:16:10,87
And at least half of you, at
least the ones who voted,

327
00:16:10,87 --> 00:16:12,33
that was I don't know.


328
00:16:12,33 --> 00:16:13,89
We have a quorum here,
but I'm not sure.

329
00:16:13,89 --> 00:16:16,045
We certainly didn't have a
majority on either side.

330
00:16:16,47 --> 00:16:19,14
Anyway this thing
does go to infinite.

331
00:16:19,42 --> 00:16:21,63
So in principle, if I had
enough blocks, I could

332
00:16:21,63 --> 00:16:23,61
get it over to here.


333
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:27,6
All right, and that's the
meaning of divergence

334
00:16:27,6 --> 00:16:28,3
in this case.


335
00:16:28,3 --> 00:16:32,43



336
00:16:32,43 --> 00:16:36,85
On the other hand, I want to
discuss with you, and the

337
00:16:36,85 --> 00:16:39,84
reason why I use this example,
is I want to discuss with you

338
00:16:39,84 --> 00:16:45,7
also what's going on with this
other inequality here, and

339
00:16:45,7 --> 00:16:47,04
what its significance is.


340
00:16:49,36 --> 00:16:52,97
Which is that it's going to
take us a lot of numbers N,

341
00:16:52,97 --> 00:16:56,565
a lot of blocks, to get
up to a certain level.

342
00:16:57,05 --> 00:16:59,35
In other words, I can't
do it with just eight

343
00:16:59,35 --> 00:17:00,49
blocks or nine blocks.


344
00:17:00,8 --> 00:17:02,3
In order to get over
here, I'd have to use

345
00:17:02,3 --> 00:17:04,65
quite a few of them.


346
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08,62
So let's just see
how many it is.

347
00:17:08,62 --> 00:17:11,12



348
00:17:11,12 --> 00:17:12,975
So I worked this out carefully.


349
00:17:14,23 --> 00:17:15,645
And let's see what I got.


350
00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:18,15



351
00:17:18,15 --> 00:17:30,78
So to get across the
lab tables, all right.

352
00:17:31,76 --> 00:17:34,406
This distance here, I
already did this secretly.

353
00:17:35,78 --> 00:17:39,07
But I don't actually even have
enough of these to show you.

354
00:17:39,69 --> 00:17:42,85
Well 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 1/2.


355
00:17:43,85 --> 00:17:44,75
I guess that's enough.


356
00:17:44,75 --> 00:17:45,83
So it's 6 and 1/2.


357
00:17:46,24 --> 00:17:49,03
So it's two lab tables
is 13 of these blocks.

358
00:17:50 --> 00:17:50,37
All right.


359
00:17:51,19 --> 00:17:58,01
So they're 13 blocks, which
is equal to 26 units.

360
00:18:00,31 --> 00:18:03,535
OK, that's how far to
get across I need.

361
00:18:04,02 --> 00:18:06,09
And the first one is already 2.


362
00:18:06,09 --> 00:18:08,59
So it's really 26
minus 2, which is 24.

363
00:18:09,47 --> 00:18:10,78
Which that's what I need.


364
00:18:11,45 --> 00:18:11,84
OK.


365
00:18:13,11 --> 00:18:22,91
So I need log N to be equal
to 24, roughly speaking,

366
00:18:22,91 --> 00:18:24,23
in order to get that far.


367
00:18:25,09 --> 00:18:27,82
So let's just see
how big that is.

368
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:28,825
All right.


369
00:18:30,3 --> 00:18:31,76
I think I worked this out.


370
00:18:31,76 --> 00:18:42,01



371
00:18:42,01 --> 00:18:43,17
So let's see.


372
00:18:43,17 --> 00:18:49,27
That means that N is equal to
either the 24th-- and if you

373
00:18:49,27 --> 00:18:59,14
realize that these blocks are 3
centimeters high-- OK let's see

374
00:18:59,14 --> 00:19:00,45
how many that we
would need here.

375
00:19:00,45 --> 00:19:01,39
That's kind of a lot.


376
00:19:02,21 --> 00:19:09,71
Let's see, it's 3 centimeters
times either the 24th, which

377
00:19:09,71 --> 00:19:14,012
is about 8 times 10
to the 8th meters.

378
00:19:15,66 --> 00:19:15,925
OK.


379
00:19:17,6 --> 00:19:20,81
And that is twice the
distance to the moon.

380
00:19:20,81 --> 00:19:32,31



381
00:19:32,31 --> 00:19:33,72
So OK, I could do it maybe.


382
00:19:35,19 --> 00:19:37,53
But I would need
a lot of blocks.

383
00:19:37,98 --> 00:19:38,435
Right?


384
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:41,15
So that's not very
plausible here, all right.

385
00:19:42,19 --> 00:19:45,5
So those of you who voted
against this were actually

386
00:19:45,5 --> 00:19:46,64
sort of half right.


387
00:19:47,08 --> 00:19:50,34
And in fact, if you wanted to
get it to the wall over there,

388
00:19:50,34 --> 00:19:53,9
which is over 30 feet, the
height would be about

389
00:19:53,9 --> 00:19:56,385
the diameter of the
observable universe.

390
00:19:57,36 --> 00:19:59,13
That's kind of a long way.


391
00:20:01,58 --> 00:20:05,92
There's one other thing that
I wanted to point out to

392
00:20:05,92 --> 00:20:08,385
you about this shape here.


393
00:20:09,34 --> 00:20:13,61
Which is that if you lean
to the left, right?

394
00:20:13,61 --> 00:20:15,58
If you put your head like
this-- of course you have to be

395
00:20:15,58 --> 00:20:23,92
on your side to look at it--
this curve is the shape

396
00:20:23,92 --> 00:20:25,41
of a logarithmic curve.


397
00:20:25,81 --> 00:20:29,24
So in other words, if you think
of the vertical as the x-axis,

398
00:20:29,24 --> 00:20:32,68
and the horizontal that way, is
the vertical, is the up

399
00:20:32,68 --> 00:20:36,64
direction, then this thing is
growing very, very,

400
00:20:36,64 --> 00:20:37,61
very, very slowly.


401
00:20:38,51 --> 00:20:43,46
If you send the x-axis all the
way up to the moon, the graph

402
00:20:43,46 --> 00:20:46,75
still hasn't gotten across
the lab tables here.

403
00:20:47,54 --> 00:20:48,905
It's only partway there.


404
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:52,29
If you go twice the distance to
the moon up that way, it's

405
00:20:52,29 --> 00:20:54,34
gotten finally to that end.


406
00:20:54,34 --> 00:20:56,645
All right so that's how
slowly the logarithm grows.

407
00:20:56,99 --> 00:20:58,275
It grows very, very slowly.


408
00:20:58,65 --> 00:21:00,46
And if you look at it another
way, if you stand on your

409
00:21:00,46 --> 00:21:03,626
head, you can see an
exponential curve.

410
00:21:05,42 --> 00:21:08,47
So you get some sense as
to the growth properties

411
00:21:08,47 --> 00:21:09,255
of these functions.


412
00:21:10,42 --> 00:21:17,23
And fortunately these are
protecting us from all kinds of

413
00:21:17,23 --> 00:21:20,2
stuff that would happen if
there weren't exponentially

414
00:21:20,2 --> 00:21:21,43
small tails in the world.


415
00:21:21,75 --> 00:21:23,91
Like you know, I could walk
through this wall which

416
00:21:23,91 --> 00:21:24,84
I wouldn't like doing.


417
00:21:27 --> 00:21:32,15
OK, now so this is
our last example.

418
00:21:32,41 --> 00:21:35,1
And the important number,
unfortunately we didn't

419
00:21:35,1 --> 00:21:36,515
discover another
important number.

420
00:21:36,79 --> 00:21:39,085
There wasn't an amazing number
place where this stopped.

421
00:21:40,25 --> 00:21:43,405
All we discovered again is
some property of infinite.

422
00:21:44,16 --> 00:21:45,72
So infinite is still
a nice number.

423
00:21:46,15 --> 00:21:50,94
And the theme here is just that
infinite isn't just one thing,

424
00:21:50,94 --> 00:21:54,135
it has a character which
is a rate of growth.

425
00:21:54,46 --> 00:21:55,84
And you shouldn't just
think of there being

426
00:21:55,84 --> 00:21:56,93
one order of infinite.


427
00:21:57,33 --> 00:21:58,53
There are lots of
different orders.

428
00:21:58,53 --> 00:22:00,19
And some of them have different
meaning from others.

429
00:22:01,28 --> 00:22:05,69
All right so that's the theme I
wanted to do, and just have a

430
00:22:05,69 --> 00:22:07,126
visceral example of infinite.


431
00:22:07,9 --> 00:22:13,23
Now, we're going to move
on now to some other

432
00:22:13,23 --> 00:22:15,476
kinds of techniques.


433
00:22:16,21 --> 00:22:18,965
And this is going to
be our last subject.

434
00:22:20,79 --> 00:22:24,02
What we're going to
talk about is what are

435
00:22:24,02 --> 00:22:25,4
known as power series.


436
00:22:27,32 --> 00:22:29,92
And we've already seen
our first power series.

437
00:22:29,92 --> 00:22:32,71



438
00:22:32,71 --> 00:22:35,24
And I'm going to
remind you of that.

439
00:22:35,24 --> 00:22:43,98



440
00:22:43,98 --> 00:22:45,49
Here we are with power series.


441
00:22:45,49 --> 00:22:51,49



442
00:22:51,49 --> 00:22:53,98
Our first series was this one.


443
00:22:53,98 --> 00:22:58,87



444
00:22:58,87 --> 00:23:02,89
And we mentioned last time
that it was equal to 1 over 1

445
00:23:02,89 --> 00:23:06,43
minus x, for x less than 1.


446
00:23:06,43 --> 00:23:09,77



447
00:23:09,77 --> 00:23:11,67
Well this one is known as
the geometric series.

448
00:23:12,04 --> 00:23:14,68
You didn't use the letter x
last time, I used the letter a.

449
00:23:15,05 --> 00:23:16,91
But this is known as
the geometric series.

450
00:23:16,91 --> 00:23:24,95



451
00:23:24,95 --> 00:23:31,55
Now I'm going to show you one
reason why this is true,

452
00:23:31,55 --> 00:23:32,635
why the formula holds.


453
00:23:33,9 --> 00:23:37,68
And it's just the kind of
manipulation that was done

454
00:23:37,68 --> 00:23:39,273
when these things were
first introduced.

455
00:23:41,27 --> 00:23:43,965
And here's the idea of a proof.


456
00:23:46,25 --> 00:23:53,38
So suppose that this sum is
equal to some number x,

457
00:23:53,38 --> 00:23:57,36
which is the sum of all
of these numbers here.

458
00:23:57,36 --> 00:24:00,54



459
00:24:00,54 --> 00:24:02,45
The first thing that
I'm going to do is I'm

460
00:24:02,45 --> 00:24:04,02
going to multiply by x.


461
00:24:05,5 --> 00:24:09,6
OK, so if I multiply by x--
let's think about that-- I

462
00:24:09,6 --> 00:24:13,81
multiply by x on both the left
and the right-hand side.

463
00:24:13,81 --> 00:24:19,595
Then on the left side, I get x
plus x-squared plus x-cubed

464
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,665
plus, and so forth.


465
00:24:20,99 --> 00:24:23,18
And on the right side,
I get S times x.

466
00:24:23,18 --> 00:24:27,38



467
00:24:27,38 --> 00:24:31,15
And now I'm going to
subtract the two equations,

468
00:24:31,15 --> 00:24:32,08
one from the other.


469
00:24:32,91 --> 00:24:35,85
And there's a very, very
substantial cancellation.

470
00:24:36,23 --> 00:24:39,18
This whole tail here
gets canceled off.

471
00:24:39,18 --> 00:24:40,69
And the only thing
that's left is the 1.

472
00:24:41,03 --> 00:24:45,63
So when I subtract, I get
1 on the left-hand side.

473
00:24:45,95 --> 00:24:51,52
And on the right-hand side,
I get S minus S times x.

474
00:24:53,09 --> 00:24:53,5
All right?


475
00:24:53,5 --> 00:24:58,9



476
00:24:58,9 --> 00:25:02,735
And now that can be rewritten
as S times 1 minus x.

477
00:25:03,85 --> 00:25:06,18
And so I've got
my formula here.

478
00:25:06,18 --> 00:25:10,214
This is 1 over 1 minus
x is equal to S.

479
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,553
All right.


480
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:17,85



481
00:25:17,85 --> 00:25:24,455
Now this reasoning
has one flaw.

482
00:25:26,34 --> 00:25:27,273
It's not complete.


483
00:25:28,12 --> 00:25:31,6
And this reasoning is
basically correct.

484
00:25:33,08 --> 00:25:45,68
But it's incomplete because
it requires that S exists.

485
00:25:45,68 --> 00:25:50,27



486
00:25:50,27 --> 00:25:52,97
For example, it doesn't
make any sense in

487
00:25:52,97 --> 00:25:54,33
the case x equals 1.


488
00:25:55,1 --> 00:25:59,05
So for example in the case
x equals 1, we have 1 plus

489
00:25:59,05 --> 00:26:03,25
1 plus 1 plus et cetera,
equals whatever we call S.

490
00:26:03,76 --> 00:26:06,37
And then when we multiply
through by 1, we get 1 plus 1

491
00:26:06,37 --> 00:26:10,28
plus 1 plus, equals S times 1.


492
00:26:10,64 --> 00:26:13,06
And now you see that the
subtraction gives us infinite

493
00:26:13,06 --> 00:26:15,85
minus infinite is equal to
infinite minus infinite.

494
00:26:16,33 --> 00:26:18,5
That's what's really
going on in the argument

495
00:26:18,5 --> 00:26:19,79
in this context.


496
00:26:19,79 --> 00:26:21,005
So it's just nonsense.


497
00:26:21,34 --> 00:26:23,145
I mean it doesn't give
us anything meaningful.

498
00:26:24,38 --> 00:26:27,09
So this argument, it's great.


499
00:26:27,09 --> 00:26:29,266
And it gives us the right
answer, but not always.

500
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33,13
And the times when it gives us
the answer, the correct answer,

501
00:26:33,13 --> 00:26:35,325
is when the series
is convergent.

502
00:26:36,8 --> 00:26:38,51
And that's why we care
about convergence.

503
00:26:38,8 --> 00:26:42,06
Because we want manipulations
like this to be allowed.

504
00:26:42,06 --> 00:26:47,78



505
00:26:47,78 --> 00:26:50,62
So the good case, this is
the red case that we were

506
00:26:50,62 --> 00:26:53,876
describing last time,
that's the bad case.

507
00:26:54,79 --> 00:26:58,18
What we want is the good
case, the convergent case.

508
00:26:58,82 --> 00:27:01,42
And that is the case
when x is less than 1.

509
00:27:01,77 --> 00:27:03,182
So this is the convergent case.


510
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:11,29



511
00:27:11,29 --> 00:27:11,625
Yep.


512
00:27:11,96 --> 00:27:14,64
OK, so they're much more
detailed things to check

513
00:27:14,64 --> 00:27:15,71
exactly what's going on.


514
00:27:15,71 --> 00:27:18,24
But I'm going to just say
general words about how you

515
00:27:18,24 --> 00:27:19,315
recognize convergence.


516
00:27:20,16 --> 00:27:22,37
And then we're not going to
worry about so much about

517
00:27:22,37 --> 00:27:24,45
convergence, because it
works very, very well.

518
00:27:24,74 --> 00:27:27,7
And it's always easy to
diagnose when there's

519
00:27:27,7 --> 00:27:29,21
convergence with
a power series.

520
00:27:31,59 --> 00:27:33,45
All right so here's
the general setup.

521
00:27:33,45 --> 00:27:44,7



522
00:27:44,7 --> 00:27:50,13
The general setup is that we
have not just the coefficients

523
00:27:50,13 --> 00:27:56,385
1 all the time, but any
numbers here, dot, dot, dot.

524
00:27:56,66 --> 00:27:59,04
And we abbreviate that with
the summation notation.

525
00:27:59,31 --> 00:28:04,15
This is the sum a n x to the
n, n equals 0 to infinite.

526
00:28:05,36 --> 00:28:07,26
And that's what's known
as a power series.

527
00:28:07,26 --> 00:28:12,37



528
00:28:12,37 --> 00:28:17,66
Fortunately there is a very
simple rule about how

529
00:28:17,66 --> 00:28:19,573
power series converge.


530
00:28:20,26 --> 00:28:21,21
And it's the following.


531
00:28:23,2 --> 00:28:28,48
There's a magic number R which
depends on these numbers here

532
00:28:28,48 --> 00:28:30,98
such that-- and this thing is
known as a radius of

533
00:28:30,98 --> 00:28:38,12
convergence-- and the
problem that we had,

534
00:28:38,12 --> 00:28:39,745
it's this number 1 here.


535
00:28:40,09 --> 00:28:42,04
This thing works
for x less than 1.

536
00:28:43,03 --> 00:28:45,37
In our case, it's
maybe x less R.

537
00:28:46,08 --> 00:28:47,96
So that's some symmetric
interval, right?

538
00:28:47,96 --> 00:28:55,39
That's the same as minus R,
less then x, less than R, and

539
00:28:55,39 --> 00:28:56,64
so where there's convergence.


540
00:28:58,31 --> 00:29:00,81
OK, where the series converges.


541
00:29:00,81 --> 00:29:07,21



542
00:29:07,21 --> 00:29:13,27
And then there's the region
where every computation that

543
00:29:13,27 --> 00:29:14,485
you give will give
you nonsense.

544
00:29:16,5 --> 00:29:24,74
So x greater than R is the sum
a sub n x to the n, diverges.

545
00:29:24,74 --> 00:29:28,71



546
00:29:28,71 --> 00:29:43,37
And x equals R is very
delicate, borderline, and

547
00:29:43,37 --> 00:29:44,99
will not be used by us.


548
00:29:44,99 --> 00:29:50,06



549
00:29:50,06 --> 00:29:52,915
OK we're going to stick inside
the radius of convergence.

550
00:29:54,75 --> 00:29:57,62
Now the way you'll be
able to recognize this,

551
00:29:57,62 --> 00:29:58,465
is the following.


552
00:29:58,92 --> 00:30:05,37
What always happens is that
these numbers tend to 0

553
00:30:05,37 --> 00:30:19,98
exponentially fast for x in R,
and doesn't even tend to 0 at

554
00:30:19,98 --> 00:30:24,97
all for x greater than R.


555
00:30:26,6 --> 00:30:29,605
Right so it'll be
totally obvious.

556
00:30:30,2 --> 00:30:33,495
When you look at this series
here, what's happening when x

557
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:35,65
less than R is that the numbers
are getting smaller and

558
00:30:35,65 --> 00:30:37,99
smaller, less than 1.


559
00:30:37,99 --> 00:30:39,56
When x is bigger than 1,
the numbers are getting

560
00:30:39,56 --> 00:30:40,1
bigger and bigger.


561
00:30:40,1 --> 00:30:41,85
There's no chance that
the series converges.

562
00:30:42,85 --> 00:30:45,456
So that's going to be the
case with all power series.

563
00:30:45,87 --> 00:30:47,26
There's going to be a cut off.


564
00:30:47,68 --> 00:30:49,44
And it'll be one
particular number.

565
00:30:49,81 --> 00:30:52,04
And below that it'll be obvious
that you have convergence, and

566
00:30:52,04 --> 00:30:52,895
you'll be able to
do computations.

567
00:30:53,26 --> 00:30:55,69
And above that every
formula will be wrong

568
00:30:55,69 --> 00:30:56,45
and won't make sense.


569
00:30:57,22 --> 00:30:58,89
So it's a very clean thing.


570
00:30:59,37 --> 00:31:02,43
There is this very subtle
borderline, but we're not going

571
00:31:02,43 --> 00:31:04,35
to discuss that in this class.


572
00:31:04,35 --> 00:31:08,91
And it's actually not used in
direct studies of power series.

573
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:13,82
AUDIENCE: How can you tell when
the numbers are declining

574
00:31:13,82 --> 00:31:16,78
exponentially fast, whereas
just, in other words 1

575
00:31:16,78 --> 00:31:17,735
over x [INAUDIBLE]?


576
00:31:18,03 --> 00:31:21,66
PROFESSOR: OK so, the question
is why was I able to

577
00:31:21,66 --> 00:31:23,07
tell you this word here?


578
00:31:23,07 --> 00:31:25,81
Why was I able to tell you not
only is it going to 0, but it's

579
00:31:25,81 --> 00:31:27,04
going exponentially fast?


580
00:31:27,55 --> 00:31:29
I'm telling you
extra information.

581
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31,79
I'm telling you it always
goes exponentially fast.

582
00:31:32,38 --> 00:31:33,556
You can identify it.


583
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:36,15



584
00:31:36,15 --> 00:31:37,62
In other words, you'll see it.


585
00:31:37,62 --> 00:31:39,155
And it will happen
every single time.

586
00:31:39,49 --> 00:31:41,34
I'm just promising you
that it works that way.

587
00:31:41,6 --> 00:31:44,83
And it's really for the same
reason that it works that way

588
00:31:44,83 --> 00:31:45,785
here, that these are powers.


589
00:31:46,84 --> 00:31:49,43
And what's going on over here
is there are, it's close to

590
00:31:49,43 --> 00:31:51,02
powers with this a sub ns.


591
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,04
All right?


592
00:31:54,64 --> 00:31:56,96
There's a long discussion
of radius of convergence

593
00:31:56,96 --> 00:31:57,71
in many textbooks.


594
00:31:58,35 --> 00:32:03,23
But really it's not necessary,
all right, for this purpose?

595
00:32:04,67 --> 00:32:05
Yeah?


596
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:07,09
AUDIENCE: How do you find R?


597
00:32:07,09 --> 00:32:08,4
PROFESSOR: The question
was how do you find R?

598
00:32:08,4 --> 00:32:10,43
Yes, so I just said, there's
a long discussion for how

599
00:32:10,43 --> 00:32:12,13
you find the radius of
convergence in textbooks.

600
00:32:12,66 --> 00:32:15,05
But we will not be
discussing that here.

601
00:32:15,8 --> 00:32:17,68
And it won't be
necessary for you.

602
00:32:17,68 --> 00:32:20,89
Because it will be obvious in
any given series what the R is.

603
00:32:20,89 --> 00:32:22,755
It will always either
1 or infinite.

604
00:32:23,65 --> 00:32:25,85
It will always work for
all x, or maybe it'll

605
00:32:25,85 --> 00:32:26,82
stop at some point.


606
00:32:26,82 --> 00:32:30,12
But it'll be very clear where
it stops, as it is for

607
00:32:30,12 --> 00:32:31,92
the geometric series.


608
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,1
All right?


609
00:32:36,07 --> 00:32:39,96
OK so now I need to give
you the basic facts, and

610
00:32:39,96 --> 00:32:40,805
give you a few examples.


611
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:44,4



612
00:32:44,4 --> 00:32:46,42
So why are we looking
at these series?

613
00:32:46,42 --> 00:32:51,24



614
00:32:51,24 --> 00:32:56,09
Well the answer is we're
looking at these series because

615
00:32:56,09 --> 00:33:00,06
the role that they play is
exactly the reverse of

616
00:33:00,06 --> 00:33:02,03
this equation here.


617
00:33:03,42 --> 00:33:06,54
That is, and this is a theme
which I have tried to emphasize

618
00:33:06,54 --> 00:33:09,555
throughout this course, you can
read equalities in

619
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:10
two directions.


620
00:33:11,87 --> 00:33:14,49
Both are interesting,
typically.

621
00:33:15,61 --> 00:33:18,22
You can think, I don't know
what the value of this is.

622
00:33:18,22 --> 00:33:19,24
Here's a way of evaluating.


623
00:33:19,24 --> 00:33:22,06
And in other words, the
right side is a formula

624
00:33:22,06 --> 00:33:22,825
for the left side.


625
00:33:23,09 --> 00:33:26,18
Or you can think of the left
side as being a formula

626
00:33:26,18 --> 00:33:27,14
for the right side.


627
00:33:27,14 --> 00:33:30,72



628
00:33:30,72 --> 00:33:34,35
And the idea of series is that
they're flexible enough to

629
00:33:34,35 --> 00:33:36,65
represent all of the functions
that we've encountered

630
00:33:36,65 --> 00:33:37,43
in this course.


631
00:33:39,3 --> 00:33:41,78
This is the tool which is very
much like the decimal

632
00:33:41,78 --> 00:33:43,88
expansion which allows you to
represent numbers like

633
00:33:43,88 --> 00:33:44,76
the square root of 2.


634
00:33:45,13 --> 00:33:47,52
Now we're going to be
representing all the numbers,

635
00:33:47,52 --> 00:33:49,95
all the functions that
we know, e to the x,

636
00:33:49,95 --> 00:33:52,24
arctangent, sine, cosine.


637
00:33:52,55 --> 00:33:55,44
All of those functions become
completely flexible, and

638
00:33:55,44 --> 00:33:57,56
completely available to
us, and computationally

639
00:33:57,56 --> 00:33:59,226
available to us directly.


640
00:33:59,9 --> 00:34:01,44
So that's what this
is a tool for.

641
00:34:01,44 --> 00:34:04,25
And it's just like decimal
expansions giving you handle

642
00:34:04,25 --> 00:34:05,24
on all real numbers.


643
00:34:05,24 --> 00:34:08,92



644
00:34:08,92 --> 00:34:09,975
So here's how it works.


645
00:34:12,11 --> 00:34:28,67
The rules for convergent
power series are just

646
00:34:28,67 --> 00:34:33,92
like polynomials.


647
00:34:33,92 --> 00:34:41,28



648
00:34:41,28 --> 00:34:43,96
All of the manipulations that
you do for power series are

649
00:34:43,96 --> 00:34:45,49
essentially the same
as for polynomials.

650
00:34:46,12 --> 00:34:48,14
So what kinds of things do
we do with polynomials?

651
00:34:49,19 --> 00:34:50,13
We add them.


652
00:34:50,13 --> 00:34:53,28



653
00:34:53,28 --> 00:34:54,445
We multiply them together.


654
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:57,63



655
00:34:57,63 --> 00:34:58,695
We do substitutions.


656
00:35:01,06 --> 00:35:01,29
Right?


657
00:35:01,29 --> 00:35:03,04
We take one function
of another function.

658
00:35:04,97 --> 00:35:06,03
We divide them.


659
00:35:06,03 --> 00:35:10,11



660
00:35:10,11 --> 00:35:10,41
OK.


661
00:35:11,59 --> 00:35:14,665
And these are all really not
very surprising operations.

662
00:35:15,04 --> 00:35:17,29
And we will be able to do
them with power series too.

663
00:35:17,71 --> 00:35:20,5
The ones that are interesting,
really interesting for

664
00:35:20,5 --> 00:35:23,58
calculus, are the last two.


665
00:35:24,36 --> 00:35:29,79
We differentiate them,
and we integrate them.

666
00:35:29,79 --> 00:35:34,07



667
00:35:34,07 --> 00:35:36,74
And all of these operations
we'll be able to do for

668
00:35:36,74 --> 00:35:38,11
power series as well.


669
00:35:38,11 --> 00:35:42,95



670
00:35:42,95 --> 00:35:48,805
So now let's explain the
high points of this.

671
00:35:49,12 --> 00:35:51,66
Which is mainly just the
differentiation and

672
00:35:51,66 --> 00:35:52,656
the integration part.


673
00:35:53,11 --> 00:36:04,02
So if I take a series like this
and so forth, the formula for

674
00:36:04,02 --> 00:36:07,6
it's derivative is just
like polynomials.

675
00:36:08,29 --> 00:36:10,04
That's what I just said,
it's just like polynomials.

676
00:36:10,22 --> 00:36:12,24
So the derivative of
the constant is 0.

677
00:36:12,57 --> 00:36:15,375
The derivative of this
term is a sub 1.

678
00:36:15,85 --> 00:36:18,845
This one is plus 2 a sub 2 x.


679
00:36:19,34 --> 00:36:23,555
This one is 3a sub 3
x-squared, et cetera.

680
00:36:23,92 --> 00:36:24,69
That's the formula.


681
00:36:27,07 --> 00:36:41,82
Similarly if I integrate, well
there's an unknown constant

682
00:36:41,82 --> 00:36:44,03
which I'm going to put
first rather than last.

683
00:36:44,93 --> 00:36:47,08
Which corresponds sort of to
the a sub 0, term which is

684
00:36:47,08 --> 00:36:48,01
going to get wiped out.


685
00:36:48,01 --> 00:36:50,51
That a sub 0 term suddenly
becomes a sub 0 x.

686
00:36:50,77 --> 00:36:54,73
And the anti-derivative of
this next term is a sub

687
00:36:54,73 --> 00:36:56,18
1 x-squared over 2.


688
00:36:56,98 --> 00:37:02,68
And the next term is a sub 2
x-cubed over 3, and so forth.

689
00:37:02,68 --> 00:37:05,2



690
00:37:05,2 --> 00:37:06,01
Yeah, question?


691
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,69
AUDIENCE: Is that a
series or a polynomial?

692
00:37:08,69 --> 00:37:09,9
PROFESSOR: Is this a
series or a polynomial?

693
00:37:10,19 --> 00:37:10,775
Good question.


694
00:37:11,18 --> 00:37:14,275
It's a polynomial if it ends.


695
00:37:14,7 --> 00:37:18,56
If it goes on infinitely
far, then it's a series.

696
00:37:19,49 --> 00:37:22,01
They look practically the
same, polynomials and series.

697
00:37:22,42 --> 00:37:24,532
There's this little
dot, dot, dot here.

698
00:37:26,4 --> 00:37:27,66
Is this a series
or a polynomial?

699
00:37:27,66 --> 00:37:28,51
It's the same rule.


700
00:37:28,78 --> 00:37:30,82
If it stops at a finite
stage, this one stops

701
00:37:30,82 --> 00:37:31,23
at a finite stage.


702
00:37:32,21 --> 00:37:34,1
If it goes on forever,
it goes on forever.

703
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,98
AUDIENCE: So I thought that the
series add up finite numbers.

704
00:37:37,98 --> 00:37:41,735
You can add up terms
of x in series?

705
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:45,52



706
00:37:45,52 --> 00:37:47,38
PROFESSOR: So an
interesting question.

707
00:37:47,38 --> 00:37:51,35
So the question that was just
asked is I thought that a

708
00:37:51,35 --> 00:37:53,06
series added up finite numbers.


709
00:37:53,06 --> 00:37:54,215
You could add up x?


710
00:37:55,14 --> 00:37:56,405
That was what you said, right?


711
00:37:56,9 --> 00:38:02,68
OK now notice that I pulled
that off on you by changing the

712
00:38:02,68 --> 00:38:07,35
letter a to the letter x at the
very beginning of this

713
00:38:07,35 --> 00:38:08,42
commentary here.


714
00:38:10,17 --> 00:38:11,36
This is a series.


715
00:38:11,76 --> 00:38:15,17
For each individual value
of x, it's a number.

716
00:38:15,63 --> 00:38:17,964
So in other words, it I plug in
here x equals 1/2, I'm going to

717
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:21,09
add 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus
1/8; and I'll get a

718
00:38:21,09 --> 00:38:22,07
number which is 2.


719
00:38:22,47 --> 00:38:24,62
And I'll plug in a number over
here, and I'll get a number.

720
00:38:25,03 --> 00:38:27,26
On the other hand, I can do
this for each value of x.

721
00:38:27,82 --> 00:38:30,71
So the interpretation of this
is that it's a function of x.

722
00:38:31,77 --> 00:38:33,57
And similarly this
is a function of x.

723
00:38:34,38 --> 00:38:37,77
It works when you plug in
the possible values x

724
00:38:37,77 --> 00:38:39,86
between minus 1 and 1.


725
00:38:42,33 --> 00:38:45,06
So there's really no
distinction there, just I

726
00:38:45,06 --> 00:38:46,22
slipped it passed you.


727
00:38:47,01 --> 00:38:48,13
These are functions of x.


728
00:38:48,13 --> 00:38:50,79



729
00:38:50,79 --> 00:38:53,29
And the notion of a power
series is this idea that you

730
00:38:53,29 --> 00:38:55,86
put coefficients on a series,
but then you allow yourself

731
00:38:55,86 --> 00:38:58,02
the flexibility to
stick powers here.

732
00:38:58,99 --> 00:39:00,76
And that's exactly
what we're doing.

733
00:39:02,12 --> 00:39:04,12
OK there are other kinds if
series where you stick other

734
00:39:04,12 --> 00:39:06,12
interesting functions in here
like sines and cosines.

735
00:39:06,12 --> 00:39:08,62
There are lots of other
series that people study.

736
00:39:08,62 --> 00:39:10,465
And these are the
simplest ones.

737
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:13,37
And all those examples are
extremely helpful for

738
00:39:13,37 --> 00:39:14,515
representing functions.


739
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:16,52
But we're only going to
do this example here.

740
00:39:18,92 --> 00:39:22,876
All right, so here
are the two rules.

741
00:39:23,61 --> 00:39:30,52
And now there's only one other
complication here which I have

742
00:39:30,52 --> 00:39:36,87
to explain to you before giving
you a bunch of examples to show

743
00:39:36,87 --> 00:39:39,02
you that this works
extremely well.

744
00:39:41,27 --> 00:39:45,09
And the last thing that I have
to do for you is explain to

745
00:39:45,09 --> 00:39:46,58
you something called
Taylor's formula.

746
00:39:46,58 --> 00:39:55,28



747
00:39:55,28 --> 00:40:00,73
Taylor's formula is the way you
get from the representations

748
00:40:00,73 --> 00:40:04,13
that we're used to a functions,
to a representation in the

749
00:40:04,13 --> 00:40:05,26
form of these coefficients.


750
00:40:06,18 --> 00:40:08,62
When I gave you the function
e to the x, it didn't

751
00:40:08,62 --> 00:40:09,53
look like a polynomial.


752
00:40:11,28 --> 00:40:15,08
And we have to figure out which
of these guys it is, if it's

753
00:40:15,08 --> 00:40:17,74
going to fall into
our category here.

754
00:40:19,09 --> 00:40:20,045
And here's the formula.


755
00:40:20,37 --> 00:40:22,18
I'll explain to you how
it works in a second.

756
00:40:23,43 --> 00:40:26,67
So the formula is f of x, turns
out there's a formula in terms

757
00:40:26,67 --> 00:40:27,84
of the derivatives of f.


758
00:40:28,56 --> 00:40:31,99
Namely, you differentiate n
times, and you evaluate it

759
00:40:31,99 --> 00:40:35,18
at 0, and you divide by n
factorial, and multiply

760
00:40:35,18 --> 00:40:36,237
by x to the n.


761
00:40:37,64 --> 00:40:39,49
So here's Taylor's formula.


762
00:40:40,51 --> 00:40:43,46
This tells you what
the Taylor series is.

763
00:40:44,27 --> 00:40:48,72
Now about half of our job for
the next few minutes is going

764
00:40:48,72 --> 00:40:51,23
to be to give examples of this.


765
00:40:51,63 --> 00:40:55,92
But let me just explain to
you why this has to be.

766
00:40:56,81 --> 00:41:00,87
If you pick out this number
here, this is the a sub n, the

767
00:41:00,87 --> 00:41:02,75
magic number a sub n here.


768
00:41:03,29 --> 00:41:04,982
So let's just illustrate it.


769
00:41:05,45 --> 00:41:11,053
If f of x happens to be a sub
zero plus a sub 1 x plus a sub

770
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:15,94
2 x-squared plus a sub 2
x-cubed plus dot, dot, dot.

771
00:41:15,94 --> 00:41:18,875
And now I differentiate
it, right?

772
00:41:19,81 --> 00:41:27,15
I get a sub 1 plus 2 sub a
2x plus 3 a sub 3 x If I

773
00:41:27,15 --> 00:41:34,75
differentiate it another time,
I get 2 a sub 2, plus 3 times 2

774
00:41:34,75 --> 00:41:38,56
a sub 3 x plus dot, dot, dot.


775
00:41:38,56 --> 00:41:45,93
And now a third time, I get 3
times 2 a sub 3 plus et cetera.

776
00:41:47,36 --> 00:41:50,39
So this next term is really
in disguise, 4 times

777
00:41:50,39 --> 00:41:54,482
3 times 2 a sub 4x.


778
00:41:56,41 --> 00:41:58,66
That's what really comes
down if I kept track of

779
00:41:58,66 --> 00:41:59,62
the fourth term there.


780
00:42:00,98 --> 00:42:02,67
So now here is my function.


781
00:42:04,66 --> 00:42:08,5
But now you see if I plug
in x equals 0, I can

782
00:42:08,5 --> 00:42:11,765
pick off the third term.


783
00:42:13,75 --> 00:42:19,87
f triple prime of 0 is equal
to 3 times 2 times a sub 3.

784
00:42:21,59 --> 00:42:23,08
Right, because all the rest
of those terms when I

785
00:42:23,08 --> 00:42:24,18
plug in 0 are just 0.


786
00:42:25,08 --> 00:42:26,265
Here's the formula.


787
00:42:26,73 --> 00:42:30,61
And so the pattern
here is this.

788
00:42:30,61 --> 00:42:32,86
And what's really going on here
is this is really 3 times

789
00:42:32,86 --> 00:42:34,788
2 times 1 equals a sub 3.


790
00:42:37,11 --> 00:42:48,48
And in general a sub n is equal
to f to the nth derivative

791
00:42:48,48 --> 00:42:49,966
divided by n factorial.


792
00:42:50,41 --> 00:42:53,99
And of course, n factorial, I
remind you, is n times n minus

793
00:42:53,99 --> 00:42:57,57
1 times n minus 2,
all the way down.

794
00:42:57,57 --> 00:43:02,6



795
00:43:02,6 --> 00:43:05,98
Now there's one more
crazy convention

796
00:43:05,98 --> 00:43:07,125
which is always used.


797
00:43:08,22 --> 00:43:12,3
Which is that there's something
very strange here down at 0,

798
00:43:12,3 --> 00:43:15,21
which is that 0 factorials
turns out, have to

799
00:43:15,21 --> 00:43:16,57
be set equal to 1.


800
00:43:16,99 --> 00:43:19,58
All right, so that's what
you do in order to make

801
00:43:19,58 --> 00:43:20,54
this formula work out.


802
00:43:20,54 --> 00:43:22,425
And that's one of the reasons
for this convention.

803
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:29,47



804
00:43:29,47 --> 00:43:29,846
All right.


805
00:43:30,6 --> 00:43:35,29
So my next goal is to
give you some examples.

806
00:43:36,68 --> 00:43:45,28
And let's do a couple.


807
00:43:45,28 --> 00:43:48,13



808
00:43:48,13 --> 00:43:53,99
So here's, well you know, I'm
going to have to let you see

809
00:43:53,99 --> 00:43:55,37
a few of them next time.


810
00:43:56,12 --> 00:43:59,23
But let me just tell you
this one, which is by

811
00:43:59,23 --> 00:44:00,82
far the most impressive.


812
00:44:00,82 --> 00:44:06,37



813
00:44:06,37 --> 00:44:10,87
So what happens with e to the
x, if a function of f of x is

814
00:44:10,87 --> 00:44:18,19
e to the x, is that it's
derivative is also x to the x.

815
00:44:18,19 --> 00:44:21,39
And its second derivative
is also e to the x.

816
00:44:21,39 --> 00:44:23,01
And it just keeps
on going that way.

817
00:44:23,01 --> 00:44:23,94
They're all the same.


818
00:44:25,18 --> 00:44:30,01
So that means that these
numbers in Taylor's formula,

819
00:44:30,01 --> 00:44:33,5
in the numerator, the nth
derivative is very

820
00:44:33,5 --> 00:44:35,266
easy to evaluate.


821
00:44:37,09 --> 00:44:38,16
It's just e to the x.


822
00:44:39,28 --> 00:44:42,81
And if I evaluated at x
equals 0, I just get 1.

823
00:44:43,89 --> 00:44:45,55
So all of those
numerators are 1.

824
00:44:46,99 --> 00:44:52,62
So the formula here, is the sum
n equals 0 to infinite, of 1

825
00:44:52,62 --> 00:44:55,987
divided by n factorial
x to the n.

826
00:44:55,987 --> 00:45:00,96



827
00:45:00,96 --> 00:45:04,56
In particular, we now have
an honest formula for

828
00:45:04,56 --> 00:45:05,77
e to the first power.


829
00:45:06,8 --> 00:45:07,89
Which is just e.


830
00:45:08,33 --> 00:45:11,705
Which if I plug it in,
x equals 1, I get 1.

831
00:45:11,97 --> 00:45:14,415
This is the n equals
0 term plus 1.

832
00:45:14,75 --> 00:45:19,2
This is the n equals 1 term
plus 1 over 2 factorial plus

833
00:45:19,2 --> 00:45:21,991
1 over 3 factorial plus
1 over 4 factorial.

834
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:27,07



835
00:45:27,07 --> 00:45:27,54
Right?


836
00:45:27,54 --> 00:45:31,36
So this is our first
honest formula for e.

837
00:45:31,36 --> 00:45:34,21
And also, this is
how you compute the

838
00:45:34,21 --> 00:45:35,34
exponential function.


839
00:45:35,34 --> 00:45:41,75



840
00:45:41,75 --> 00:45:49,98
Finally if you take a function
like sine x, what you'll

841
00:45:49,98 --> 00:45:52,78
discover is that we can
complete the sort of strange

842
00:45:52,78 --> 00:45:56,57
business that we did at the
beginning of the course-- or

843
00:45:56,57 --> 00:46:03,48
cosine x-- where we took the
linear and quadratic

844
00:46:03,48 --> 00:46:03,97
approximations.


845
00:46:04,95 --> 00:46:08,62
Now we're going to get complete
formulas for these functions.

846
00:46:10,06 --> 00:46:15,18
Sine x turns out to be equal to
x minus x-cubed over 3

847
00:46:15,18 --> 00:46:20,62
factorial plus x to the 5th
over 5 factorial minus x to the

848
00:46:20,62 --> 00:46:23,5
7th over 7 factorial,
et cetera.

849
00:46:24,86 --> 00:46:29,51
And cosine x is equal to 1,
minus x-squared over 2

850
00:46:29,51 --> 00:46:35,52
factorial-- that's the same as
this 2 here-- plus x to the 4th

851
00:46:35,52 --> 00:46:41,07
over 4 factorial minus x to the
6th over 6 factorial,

852
00:46:41,07 --> 00:46:41,783
plus et cetera.


853
00:46:42,59 --> 00:46:48,03
Now these may feel like they're
hard to memorize because I've

854
00:46:48,03 --> 00:46:49,425
just pulled them out of a hat.


855
00:46:49,425 --> 00:46:51,99



856
00:46:51,99 --> 00:46:54,67
I do expect you to know them.


857
00:46:55,63 --> 00:46:58,283
They're actually extremely
similar formulas.

858
00:46:58,99 --> 00:47:01,815
The exponential here just has
this collection of factorials.

859
00:47:02,23 --> 00:47:06,86
The sine is all the odd powers
with alternating sines.

860
00:47:06,86 --> 00:47:09,95
And the cosine is all the even
powers with alternating sines.

861
00:47:10,26 --> 00:47:13,815
So all three of them form
part of the same family.

862
00:47:14,13 --> 00:47:16,9
So this will actually make it
easier for you to remember,

863
00:47:16,9 --> 00:47:18,15
rather than harder.


864
00:47:18,15 --> 00:47:21,49



865
00:47:21,49 --> 00:47:25,38
And so with that, I'll leave
the practice on differentiation

866
00:47:25,38 --> 00:47:26,21
for next time.


867
00:47:26,21 --> 00:47:27,57
And good luck, everybody.


868
00:47:27,57 --> 00:47:29,99
I'll talk to individually.


869
00:47:29,99 --> 00:47:30,585
