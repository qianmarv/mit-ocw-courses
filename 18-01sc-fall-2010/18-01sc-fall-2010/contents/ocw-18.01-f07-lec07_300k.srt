9
00:00:21,7 --> 00:00:25,93
PROFESSOR: Right now, we're
finishing up with the first

10
00:00:25,93 --> 00:00:31,89
unit, and I'd like to continue
in this lecture, lecture seven,

11
00:00:31,89 --> 00:00:45,51
with some final remarks
about exponents.

12
00:00:45,51 --> 00:00:49,95
So what I'd like to do is just
review something that I did

13
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:53,19
quickly last time, and make a
few philosophical

14
00:00:53,19 --> 00:00:53,92
remarks about it.

15
00:00:53,92 --> 00:00:57,88
I think that the steps involved
were maybe a little tricky, and

16
00:00:57,88 --> 00:01:00,68
so I'd like to go through
it one more time.

17
00:01:00,68 --> 00:01:03,02
Remember, that we were
talking about this

18
00:01:03,02 --> 00:01:05,37
number ak, which is (1

19
00:01:05,37 --> 00:01:05,51
1/k)^k.

20
00:01:05,51 --> 00:01:08,27

21
00:01:08,27 --> 00:01:11,82
And what we showed was that
the limit as k goes to

22
00:01:11,82 --> 00:01:16,92
infinity of ak was e.

23
00:01:16,92 --> 00:01:21,29
So the first thing that I'd
like to do is just explain the

24
00:01:21,29 --> 00:01:27,98
proof a little bit more clearly
than I did last time with fewer

25
00:01:27,98 --> 00:01:31,83
symbols, or at least with this
abbreviation of the symbol

26
00:01:31,83 --> 00:01:35,05
here, to show you what
we actually did.

27
00:01:35,05 --> 00:01:43,79
So I'll just remind you of what
we did last time, and the first

28
00:01:43,79 --> 00:01:46,95
observation was to check,
rather than the limit of

29
00:01:46,95 --> 00:01:49,55
this function, but to
take the ln first.

30
00:01:49,55 --> 00:01:52,17
And this is typically what's
done when you have an

31
00:01:52,17 --> 00:01:54,81
exponential, when you
have an exponent.

32
00:01:54,81 --> 00:01:59,31
And what we found was that
the limit here was 1

33
00:01:59,31 --> 00:02:03,5
as k goes to infinity.

34
00:02:03,5 --> 00:02:05,16
So last time, this
is what we did.

35
00:02:05,16 --> 00:02:08,49
And I just wanted to be
careful and show you exactly

36
00:02:08,49 --> 00:02:09,83
what the next step is.

37
00:02:09,83 --> 00:02:14,36
If you exponentiate this fact;
you take e to this power,

38
00:02:14,36 --> 00:02:21,23
that's going to tend to
e ^ 1, which is just e.

39
00:02:21,23 --> 00:02:26,57
And then, we just observe
that this is the same as ak.

40
00:02:26,57 --> 00:02:32,18
So the basic ingredient
here is that e ^ ln a = a.

41
00:02:32,18 --> 00:02:36,99
That's because the ln function
is the inverse of the

42
00:02:36,99 --> 00:02:38,03
exponential function.

43
00:02:38,03 --> 00:02:38,86
Yes, question?

44
00:02:38,86 --> 00:02:54,19
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

45
00:02:54,19 --> 00:02:59,42
PROFESSOR: So the question was,
wouldn't the log of this be 0

46
00:02:59,42 --> 00:03:01,53
because ak is tending to 1.

47
00:03:01,53 --> 00:03:03,83
But ak isn't tending to 1.

48
00:03:03,83 --> 00:03:06,64
Who said it was?

49
00:03:06,64 --> 00:03:08,89
If you take the logarithm,
which is what we did last

50
00:03:08,89 --> 00:03:12,88
time, logarithm of ak is
indeed k(ln(1 + 1/k)).

51
00:03:12,88 --> 00:03:17,03

52
00:03:17,03 --> 00:03:18,52
That does not tend to 0.

53
00:03:18,52 --> 00:03:22,61
This part of it tends to 0, and
this part tends to infinity.

54
00:03:22,61 --> 00:03:26,46
And they balance each
other, 0 times infinity.

55
00:03:26,46 --> 00:03:29,18
We don't really know yet from
this expression, in fact we did

56
00:03:29,18 --> 00:03:32,63
some cleverness with limits and
derivatives, to figure

57
00:03:32,63 --> 00:03:33,23
out this limit.

58
00:03:33,23 --> 00:03:34,28
It was a very subtle thing.

59
00:03:34,28 --> 00:03:37,56
It turned out to be 1.

60
00:03:37,56 --> 00:03:38,85
All right?

61
00:03:38,85 --> 00:03:41,74
Now, the thing that I'd like to
say - I'm sorry I'm going to

62
00:03:41,74 --> 00:03:46,1
erase this aside here - but you
need to go back to your notes

63
00:03:46,1 --> 00:03:49,12
and remember that this is
what we did last time.

64
00:03:49,12 --> 00:03:51,97
Because I want to have room for
the next comment that I want to

65
00:03:51,97 --> 00:03:54,42
make on this little
blackboard here.

66
00:03:54,42 --> 00:03:59,66
What we just derived was this
property here, but I made a

67
00:03:59,66 --> 00:04:03
claim yesterday, and I just
want to emphasize it again so

68
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07,83
that we realized what it
is that we're doing.

69
00:04:07,83 --> 00:04:08,91
I looked at this backwards.

70
00:04:08,91 --> 00:04:11,24
One way you can think of this
is we're evaluating this

71
00:04:11,24 --> 00:04:13
limit and getting an answer.

72
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16,74
But all equalities can be
read both directions.

73
00:04:16,74 --> 00:04:21,3
And we can write it the other
way: e = the limit, as k goes

74
00:04:21,3 --> 00:04:26,38
to infinity, of this
expression here.

75
00:04:26,38 --> 00:04:28,64
So that's just the same thing.

76
00:04:28,64 --> 00:04:31,32
And if we read it backwards,
what we're saying is that this

77
00:04:31,32 --> 00:04:35,7
limit is a formula for e.

78
00:04:35,7 --> 00:04:38,44
So this is very typical
of mathematics.

79
00:04:38,44 --> 00:04:40,7
You want to always reverse your
perspective all the time.

80
00:04:40,7 --> 00:04:45,17
Equations work both ways, and
in this case, we have two

81
00:04:45,17 --> 00:04:46,3
different things here.

82
00:04:46,3 --> 00:04:50,55
This e was what we defined as
the base, which when you graph

83
00:04:50,55 --> 00:04:54,51
e ^ x, you get slope 1 at 0.

84
00:04:54,51 --> 00:04:56,85
And then it turns out to be
equal to this limit, which we

85
00:04:56,85 --> 00:04:59,06
can calculate numerically.

86
00:04:59,06 --> 00:05:02,1
If you do this on your
calculators, you, of course,

87
00:05:02,1 --> 00:05:05,53
will have a way of programming
in this number and

88
00:05:05,53 --> 00:05:07,29
evaluating it for each k.

89
00:05:07,29 --> 00:05:10,88
And you'll have another button
available to evaluate this one.

90
00:05:10,88 --> 00:05:13,39
So another way of saying it is
it that there's a relationship

91
00:05:13,39 --> 00:05:14,64
between these two things.

92
00:05:14,64 --> 00:05:19,21
And all of Calculus is a matter
of getting these relationships.

93
00:05:19,21 --> 00:05:21,86
So we can look at these things
in several different ways.

94
00:05:21,86 --> 00:05:25,17
And indeed, that's what we're
going to be doing at least at

95
00:05:25,17 --> 00:05:27,04
the end of today in talking
about derivatives.

96
00:05:27,04 --> 00:05:30,23
A lot of times when we talk
about derivative, we're trying

97
00:05:30,23 --> 00:05:34,78
to look at them from several
perspectives at once.

98
00:05:34,78 --> 00:05:37,58
Okay, so I have to keep on
going with exponents, because

99
00:05:37,58 --> 00:05:40,13
I have one loose end.

100
00:05:40,13 --> 00:05:44,49
One loose end that I
did not cover yet.

101
00:05:44,49 --> 00:05:49,07
There's one very important
formula that's left, and it's

102
00:05:49,07 --> 00:05:51,92
the derivative of the powers.

103
00:05:51,92 --> 00:05:54,51
We actually didn't do this
- well we did it for

104
00:05:54,51 --> 00:05:57,12
rational numbers r.

105
00:05:57,12 --> 00:06:00,07
So this is the formula here.

106
00:06:00,07 --> 00:06:06,2
But now we're going to check
this for all real numbers, r.

107
00:06:06,2 --> 00:06:09,2
So including all the
irrational ones as well.

108
00:06:09,2 --> 00:06:14,2
This is also good practice
for using base e and using

109
00:06:14,2 --> 00:06:16,48
logarithmic differentiation.

110
00:06:16,48 --> 00:06:21,63
So let me do this by our two
methods that we can use to

111
00:06:21,63 --> 00:06:26,16
handle exponential
type problems.

112
00:06:26,16 --> 00:06:32,07
So method one was base e.

113
00:06:32,07 --> 00:06:34,78
So if I just rewrite this base
e again, that's just this

114
00:06:34,78 --> 00:06:44,53
formula over here. x ^ r =
(e^ln x)^r, which

115
00:06:44,53 --> 00:06:50,35
is e ^ r ln x.

116
00:06:50,35 --> 00:06:55,32
Okay, so now I can
differentiate this.

117
00:06:55,32 --> 00:07:04,65
So I get that d / dx (x^r), now
I'm going to use prime

118
00:07:04,65 --> 00:07:06,86
notation, because I don't want
to keep on writing that d /

119
00:07:06,86 --> 00:07:10,58
dx here; e ^ (r ln x)'.

120
00:07:10,58 --> 00:07:13,89

121
00:07:13,89 --> 00:07:18,61
And now, what I can do is
I can use the chain rule.

122
00:07:18,61 --> 00:07:21,64
The chain rule says that it's
the derivative of a this times

123
00:07:21,64 --> 00:07:24,38
the derivative of the function.

124
00:07:24,38 --> 00:07:29,5
So the derivative of the
exponential is just itself.

125
00:07:29,5 --> 00:07:32,04
And the derivative of this
guy here, well I'll write

126
00:07:32,04 --> 00:07:35,4
it out once, is (r ln x)'.

127
00:07:35,4 --> 00:07:39,7

128
00:07:39,7 --> 00:07:42,25
So what's that equal to?

129
00:07:42,25 --> 00:07:45,89
Well, each of the r ln
x's is just x ^ r.

130
00:07:45,89 --> 00:07:50,13
And this derivative here is...

131
00:07:50,13 --> 00:07:53,87
Well the derivative of r is 0.

132
00:07:53,87 --> 00:07:54,86
This is a constant.

133
00:07:54,86 --> 00:07:56,68
It just factors out.

134
00:07:56,68 --> 00:07:58,94
And ln x now the derivative...

135
00:07:58,94 --> 00:08:01,69
What's the derivative of ln x?

136
00:08:01,69 --> 00:08:06,57
1 / x, so this is going
to be times r / x.

137
00:08:06,57 --> 00:08:10,21
And now, we rewrite it in the
customary form, which is r, we

138
00:08:10,21 --> 00:08:13,04
put the r in front,
x ^ (r - 1).

139
00:08:13,04 --> 00:08:13,82
Ok?

140
00:08:13,82 --> 00:08:19,06
So I just derived the
formula for you.

141
00:08:19,06 --> 00:08:23,31
And it didn't matter whether r
was rational or irrational,

142
00:08:23,31 --> 00:08:25,32
it's the same proof.

143
00:08:25,32 --> 00:08:29,44
Okay so now I have to show you
how method two works as well.

144
00:08:29,44 --> 00:08:35,18
So let's do method two,
which we called logarithmic

145
00:08:35,18 --> 00:08:39,28
differentiation.

146
00:08:39,28 --> 00:08:44,37
And so here I'll use a
symbol, say u for x ^ r, and

147
00:08:44,37 --> 00:08:44,93
I'll take its logarithm.

148
00:08:44,93 --> 00:08:50,48
That's r ln x.

149
00:08:50,48 --> 00:08:51,83
And now I differentiate it.

150
00:08:51,83 --> 00:08:54,99
I'll leave that in the middle,
because I want to remember

151
00:08:54,99 --> 00:08:57,27
the key property of
logarithmic differention.

152
00:08:57,27 --> 00:08:58,95
But first I'll
differentiate it.

153
00:08:58,95 --> 00:09:00,63
Later on, what I'm going
to use is that this

154
00:09:00,63 --> 00:09:02,62
is the same as u'/u.

155
00:09:02,62 --> 00:09:06,47
This is one way of evaluating
a logarithmic derivative.

156
00:09:06,47 --> 00:09:09,23
And then the other is to
differentiate the explicit

157
00:09:09,23 --> 00:09:10,98
function that we
have over here.

158
00:09:10,98 --> 00:09:16,79
And that is just,
as we said, r /x.

159
00:09:16,79 --> 00:09:24,54
So now, I multiply through,
and I get u' = u(r/x), which

160
00:09:24,54 --> 00:09:29,75
is just x^r(r/x), which is
just what we did before.

161
00:09:29,75 --> 00:09:33,41
It's r x ^ (r - 1).

162
00:09:33,41 --> 00:09:38,11
Again, you can now see by
comparing these two pieces

163
00:09:38,11 --> 00:09:41,47
of arithmetic that they're
basically the same.

164
00:09:41,47 --> 00:09:43,95
Pretty much every time you
convert to base c or you do

165
00:09:43,95 --> 00:09:46,09
logarithmic differentiation,
it'll amount to the same

166
00:09:46,09 --> 00:09:48,27
thing, provided you
don't get mixed up.

167
00:09:48,27 --> 00:09:51,72
You generally have to
introduce a new symbol here.

168
00:09:51,72 --> 00:09:55,84
On the other hand, you're
dealing with exponents there.

169
00:09:55,84 --> 00:10:00,99
It's worth it to know
both points of view.

170
00:10:00,99 --> 00:10:05,6
All right, so now I want to
make one last remark before

171
00:10:05,6 --> 00:10:09,91
we finish with exponents.

172
00:10:09,91 --> 00:10:16,34
And, I'll try to sell this to
you in a lot of ways as the

173
00:10:16,34 --> 00:10:21,49
court goes on, but one thing
that I want to try to

174
00:10:21,49 --> 00:10:27,21
emphasize is that the natural
logarithm really is natural.

175
00:10:27,21 --> 00:10:39,92
So, I claim that the
natural log is natural.

176
00:10:39,92 --> 00:10:45,72
And the example that we're
going to use for this

177
00:10:45,72 --> 00:10:53,34
illustration is economics.

178
00:10:53,34 --> 00:10:54,09
Okay?

179
00:10:54,09 --> 00:10:58,52
So let me explain to why the
natural log is the one that's

180
00:10:58,52 --> 00:11:00,82
natural for economics.

181
00:11:00,82 --> 00:11:06,2
If you are imagining the price
of a stock that you own goes

182
00:11:06,2 --> 00:11:11,16
down by a dollar, that's a
totally meaningless statement.

183
00:11:11,16 --> 00:11:13,48
It depends on a lot of things.

184
00:11:13,48 --> 00:11:15,73
In particular, it depends on
whether the original price

185
00:11:15,73 --> 00:11:18,3
was a dollar or 100 dollars.

186
00:11:18,3 --> 00:11:22,13
So there's not much meaning
to these absolute numbers.

187
00:11:22,13 --> 00:11:25,08
It's always the
ratios that matter.

188
00:11:25,08 --> 00:11:30,83
So, for example, I just looked
up an hour ago, the London

189
00:11:30,83 --> 00:11:43,64
Exchange close, and it was down
27.9, which as I said, is

190
00:11:43,64 --> 00:11:47,39
pretty meaningless unless
you know what the actual

191
00:11:47,39 --> 00:11:50,05
total of this index is.

192
00:11:50,05 --> 00:11:54,2
It turns out it was 6,432.

193
00:11:54,2 --> 00:11:59,02
So the change in the price,
divided by the price, which

194
00:11:59,02 --> 00:12:07,55
in this case is 27.9 /
6,432, is what matters.

195
00:12:07,55 --> 00:12:12,01
And, in this case, it
happens to be 0.43%.

196
00:12:12,01 --> 00:12:12,29
All right?

197
00:12:12,29 --> 00:12:14,27
That's what happened today.

198
00:12:14,27 --> 00:12:18,7
And similarly, if you take the
infinitessimal of this, people

199
00:12:18,7 --> 00:12:21,26
think of days as being
relatively small increments

200
00:12:21,26 --> 00:12:25,11
when you're investing in a
stock, you would be interested

201
00:12:25,11 --> 00:12:28,69
in the infinitessimal
sense, p'/p.

202
00:12:28,69 --> 00:12:33,08
The derivative of p / p.

203
00:12:33,08 --> 00:12:35,53
That's just (ln p)'.

204
00:12:35,53 --> 00:12:38,16

205
00:12:38,16 --> 00:12:42,66
So this is the - let me put a
little box around it - the

206
00:12:42,66 --> 00:12:45,46
formula of logarithmic
differentiation.

207
00:12:45,46 --> 00:12:49,7
But let me just emphasize that
it has an actual significance,

208
00:12:49,7 --> 00:12:52,43
and it's the one that's used by
economists and people who

209
00:12:52,43 --> 00:12:54,45
are modeling prices of
things all the time.

210
00:12:54,45 --> 00:12:58,62
They never use absolute prices
when there are large swings.

211
00:12:58,62 --> 00:13:01,01
They always use the
log of the price.

212
00:13:01,01 --> 00:13:07,01
And there's no point in using
log base 10, or log base 2.

213
00:13:07,01 --> 00:13:08,18
Those give you junk.

214
00:13:08,18 --> 00:13:11,19
They give you an extra
factor of log 2.

215
00:13:11,19 --> 00:13:14,87
It's the natural log that's
the obvious one to use.

216
00:13:14,87 --> 00:13:19,38
It's completely straightforward
that this is a simpler

217
00:13:19,38 --> 00:13:22,6
expression than using log base
10 and having a factor of

218
00:13:22,6 --> 00:13:26,8
natural log of 10 there, which
would just mess everything up.

219
00:13:26,8 --> 00:13:29,36
All right, so this is
just one illustration.

220
00:13:29,36 --> 00:13:32,2
Anything that has to do
with ratios is going to

221
00:13:32,2 --> 00:13:36,16
encounter logarithms.

222
00:13:36,16 --> 00:13:41,27
All right, so that's
pretty much it.

223
00:13:41,27 --> 00:13:45,99
That's all I want to
say for now anyway.

224
00:13:45,99 --> 00:13:48,28
There's lots more to say, but
we'll be saying it when we do

225
00:13:48,28 --> 00:13:51,25
applications of derivatives
in the second unit.

226
00:13:51,25 --> 00:13:54,45
So now, what I'd like to
do is to start a review.

227
00:13:54,45 --> 00:13:57,79
I'm just going to run through
what we did in this unit.

228
00:13:57,79 --> 00:14:01,58
I'll tell you approximately
what I expect from you on the

229
00:14:01,58 --> 00:14:06,15
test that's coming up tomorrow.

230
00:14:06,15 --> 00:14:14,64
And, well, so let's get
started with that.

231
00:14:14,64 --> 00:14:27,05
So this is a review
of Unit One.

232
00:14:27,05 --> 00:14:32,61
And I'm just going to put on
the board all of the things

233
00:14:32,61 --> 00:14:35,75
that you need to think about,
anyway, keep in your head.

234
00:14:35,75 --> 00:14:41,75
And there what are
called general formulas

235
00:14:41,75 --> 00:14:45,07
for derivatives.

236
00:14:45,07 --> 00:14:51,97
And then there are
the specific ones.

237
00:14:51,97 --> 00:14:55,92
And let me just remind you what
the general formulas are.

238
00:14:55,92 --> 00:15:01,44
There's what you do to
differentiate a sum, a multiple

239
00:15:01,44 --> 00:15:08,19
of a function, the product
rule, the quotient rule.

240
00:15:08,19 --> 00:15:11,55
Those are several
general formulas.

241
00:15:11,55 --> 00:15:15,02
And then there's one more,
which is the chain rule, which

242
00:15:15,02 --> 00:15:17,45
I'm going to say just a
little bit more about.

243
00:15:17,45 --> 00:15:22,35
So the derivative of a function
of a function is the derivative

244
00:15:22,35 --> 00:15:26,65
of the function times the
derivative of the

245
00:15:26,65 --> 00:15:27,43
other function.

246
00:15:27,43 --> 00:15:33,78
So here, I've
abbreviated u = u(x).

247
00:15:33,78 --> 00:15:36,63
Right, so this is one of
two ways of writing it.

248
00:15:36,63 --> 00:15:40,03
The other way is also one that
you can keep in mind and you

249
00:15:40,03 --> 00:15:42,47
might find easier to remember.

250
00:15:42,47 --> 00:15:46,69
It's probably a good idea
to remember both formulas.

251
00:15:46,69 --> 00:15:53,27
And then the last type of
general formula that we did

252
00:15:53,27 --> 00:15:56,95
was implicit differentiation.

253
00:15:56,95 --> 00:15:59,2
Okay?

254
00:15:59,2 --> 00:16:04,7
So when you do implicit
differentiation, you have an

255
00:16:04,7 --> 00:16:09,27
equation and you don't try to
solve for the unknown function.

256
00:16:09,27 --> 00:16:13,11
You just put it in its simplest
form and you differentiate.

257
00:16:13,11 --> 00:16:20,44
So, we actually did this, in
particular, for inverses.

258
00:16:20,44 --> 00:16:23,805
That was a very, very key
method for calculating the

259
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,18
inverses of functions.

260
00:16:25,18 --> 00:16:28,6
And it's also true that
logarithmic differentiation

261
00:16:28,6 --> 00:16:31,42
is of this type.

262
00:16:31,42 --> 00:16:33,31
This is a transformation.

263
00:16:33,31 --> 00:16:34,84
We're differentiating
something else.

264
00:16:34,84 --> 00:16:37,92
We're transforming the equation
by taking its logarithm

265
00:16:37,92 --> 00:16:40,98
and then differentiating.

266
00:16:40,98 --> 00:16:45,2
Ok, so there are a number of
different ways this is applied.

267
00:16:45,2 --> 00:16:48,45
It can also be applied, anyway,
these are two of them.

268
00:16:48,45 --> 00:16:50,32
So maybe in parenthesis.

269
00:16:50,32 --> 00:16:53,12
These are just examples.

270
00:16:53,12 --> 00:16:54,35
All right.

271
00:16:54,35 --> 00:16:58,55
I'll try to give examples
of at least a few of

272
00:16:58,55 --> 00:16:59,96
these rules later.

273
00:16:59,96 --> 00:17:05,76
So now, the specific functions
that you know how to

274
00:17:05,76 --> 00:17:08,36
differentiate: well you know
how to differentiate now x ^ r

275
00:17:08,36 --> 00:17:11,41
thanks to what I just did.

276
00:17:11,41 --> 00:17:15,77
We have the sine and the cosine
functions, which you're

277
00:17:15,77 --> 00:17:19,5
responsible for knowing what
their derivatives are.

278
00:17:19,5 --> 00:17:26,49
And then other trig functions
like tan and secant.

279
00:17:26,49 --> 00:17:29,81
We generally don't bother with
cosecants and cotangents,

280
00:17:29,81 --> 00:17:32,19
because everything can be
expressed in terms

281
00:17:32,19 --> 00:17:34,03
of these anyway.

282
00:17:34,03 --> 00:17:35,87
Actually, you can really
express everything in terms

283
00:17:35,87 --> 00:17:36,95
of sines and cosines.

284
00:17:36,95 --> 00:17:39,76
But what you'll find is that
it's much more convenient to

285
00:17:39,76 --> 00:17:42,73
remember the derivatives
of these as well.

286
00:17:42,73 --> 00:17:45,87
So memorize all of these.

287
00:17:45,87 --> 00:17:49,81
All right, and then
we had e^x and ln x.

288
00:17:49,81 --> 00:17:53,92
And we had the inverses
of the trig functions.

289
00:17:53,92 --> 00:18:00,01
These were the two that we did:
the arctangent and the arcsin.

290
00:18:00,01 --> 00:18:02,22
So those are the ones
you're responsible for.

291
00:18:02,22 --> 00:18:06,97
You should have enough time,
anyway, to work out anything

292
00:18:06,97 --> 00:18:09,39
else, if you know these.

293
00:18:09,39 --> 00:18:11,8
All right, so basically the
idea is you have a bunch

294
00:18:11,8 --> 00:18:13,07
of special formulas.

295
00:18:13,07 --> 00:18:14,82
You have a bunch of
general formulas.

296
00:18:14,82 --> 00:18:17,87
You put them together,
and you can generate

297
00:18:17,87 --> 00:18:20,97
pretty much anything.

298
00:18:20,97 --> 00:18:24,6
Okay, so let's do a few
examples before going

299
00:18:24,6 --> 00:18:41,29
on with the review.

300
00:18:41,29 --> 00:18:48,23
Okay, so I do want to do a few
examples in sort of increasing

301
00:18:48,23 --> 00:18:50,84
level of difficulty and how you
would combine these

302
00:18:50,84 --> 00:18:51,42
things together.

303
00:18:51,42 --> 00:18:56,38
So first of all, you should
remember that if you

304
00:18:56,38 --> 00:19:02,35
differentiate the secant
function, that's just - oh I

305
00:19:02,35 --> 00:19:04,01
just realized that I wanted
to say something else

306
00:19:04,01 --> 00:19:06,63
before - so forget that.

307
00:19:06,63 --> 00:19:08,06
We'll do that in a second.

308
00:19:08,06 --> 00:19:10,98
I wanted to make some
general remarks.

309
00:19:10,98 --> 00:19:17,29
So there's one rule that you
discussed in my absence,

310
00:19:17,29 --> 00:19:19,07
which is the chain rule.

311
00:19:19,07 --> 00:19:22,1
And I do want to make just a
couple of remarks about the

312
00:19:22,1 --> 00:19:28,1
chain rule now to remind you
of what it is, and also to

313
00:19:28,1 --> 00:19:30,16
present some consequences.

314
00:19:30,16 --> 00:19:39,19
So, a little bit of extra
on the chain rule.

315
00:19:39,19 --> 00:19:43,72
The first thing that I want
say is that we didn't really

316
00:19:43,72 --> 00:19:46,66
fully explain why it's true.

317
00:19:46,66 --> 00:19:54,14
And I do want to just explain
it by example, okay?

318
00:19:54,14 --> 00:20:01,18
So imagine that you have a
function which is, say, 10x

319
00:20:01,18 --> 00:20:02,01
b.

320
00:20:02,01 --> 00:20:02,5
All right?

321
00:20:02,5 --> 00:20:03,69
So y = 10x

322
00:20:03,69 --> 00:20:04,98
b.

323
00:20:04,98 --> 00:20:09,97
Then obviously, y is changing
10 times as fast as b, right?

324
00:20:09,97 --> 00:20:18,06
The issue is this number
here, dy / dx = 10.

325
00:20:18,06 --> 00:20:23,53
And now if x is a function of
something, say t, shifted

326
00:20:23,53 --> 00:20:34,29
by some other constant
here, then dx/dt = 5.

327
00:20:34,29 --> 00:20:38,51
Now all the chain rule is
saying is that if y is going 10

328
00:20:38,51 --> 00:20:44,74
times as fast as t, I'm sorry
as x, and x is going 5 times as

329
00:20:44,74 --> 00:20:50,62
fast as t, then y is going
50 times as fast as t.

330
00:20:50,62 --> 00:20:54,85
And algebraically, all this
means is if I plug in and

331
00:20:54,85 --> 00:20:57,1
substitute, which is what the
composition of the two

332
00:20:57,1 --> 00:21:04,57
functions amounts to, 10(5t +
a) + b and I multiply

333
00:21:04,57 --> 00:21:07,91
it out, I get 50t

334
00:21:07,91 --> 00:21:09,2
10a b.

335
00:21:09,2 --> 00:21:12
Now these terms don't matter.

336
00:21:12 --> 00:21:13,03
The constant terms
don't matter.

337
00:21:13,03 --> 00:21:14,8
The rate is 50.

338
00:21:14,8 --> 00:21:17,6
And so the consequence, if we
put them together, is that

339
00:21:17,6 --> 00:21:30,17
dy/dt = 10*5, which is 50.

340
00:21:30,17 --> 00:21:32,4
All right, so this is
in a nutshell why the

341
00:21:32,4 --> 00:21:33,63
chain rule works.

342
00:21:33,63 --> 00:21:39,45
And why these rates multiply.

343
00:21:39,45 --> 00:21:43,05
The second thing that I wanted
to say about the chain rule is

344
00:21:43,05 --> 00:21:45,89
that it has a few consequences
that make some of the other

345
00:21:45,89 --> 00:21:50,22
rules a little easier to
remember or possibly to avoid.

346
00:21:50,22 --> 00:21:55,46
The messiest rule in my humble
opinion is the quotient

347
00:21:55,46 --> 00:21:59,43
rule, which is kind of
a nuisance to remember.

348
00:21:59,43 --> 00:22:02,49
So let me just remind you, if
you take just the reciprocal

349
00:22:02,49 --> 00:22:05,99
of a function, and you
differentiate it, there's

350
00:22:05,99 --> 00:22:08,17
another way of looking at this.

351
00:22:08,17 --> 00:22:11,03
And it's actually the way that
I use, so I want to encourage

352
00:22:11,03 --> 00:22:12,8
you to think about
it this way too.

353
00:22:12,8 --> 00:22:16,7
This is the same as
(v^-1)' power .

354
00:22:16,7 --> 00:22:18,97
And now instead of using the
quotient rule, which we

355
00:22:18,97 --> 00:22:25,69
could've used, we can use the
chain rule here with the

356
00:22:25,69 --> 00:22:29,72
power -1, which works
by the power law.

357
00:22:29,72 --> 00:22:30,96
So what is this equal to?

358
00:22:30,96 --> 00:22:33,64
This is equal to (-v^-2)(v').

359
00:22:33,64 --> 00:22:38,93

360
00:22:38,93 --> 00:22:42,73
So here, I've applied the
chain rule rather than

361
00:22:42,73 --> 00:22:47,37
the quotient rule.

362
00:22:47,37 --> 00:22:53,74
And similarly, suppose
I wanted to derive the

363
00:22:53,74 --> 00:22:54,56
full quotient rule.

364
00:22:54,56 --> 00:22:57,24
Well, now this may or
may not be easier.

365
00:22:57,24 --> 00:22:59,77
But this is one way of
remembering what's going on.

366
00:22:59,77 --> 00:23:04,67
If you convert it to (uv^-1)
and you differentiate

367
00:23:04,67 --> 00:23:09,18
that, now I can use the
product rule on this.

368
00:23:09,18 --> 00:23:11,43
Of course, I have to
use the chain rule and

369
00:23:11,43 --> 00:23:13,03
this rule as well.

370
00:23:13,03 --> 00:23:15,62
So what do I get?

371
00:23:15,62 --> 00:23:20,69
I get u' , the inverse,

372
00:23:20,69 --> 00:23:22,81
u, and then I have to
differentiate the v inverse.

373
00:23:22,81 --> 00:23:24,49
That's the formula
right up here.

374
00:23:24,49 --> 00:23:25,29
That's (-v^-2)(v').

375
00:23:25,29 --> 00:23:30,3

376
00:23:30,3 --> 00:23:33,23
So that's one way of doing it.

377
00:23:33,23 --> 00:23:35,93
This actually explains the
funny minus sign when you

378
00:23:35,93 --> 00:23:38,56
differentiate v in the formula.

379
00:23:38,56 --> 00:23:41,73
The other formula, the other
way that we did it, was by

380
00:23:41,73 --> 00:23:44,37
putting this over a
common denominator.

381
00:23:44,37 --> 00:23:49,33
The common denominator was v^2.

382
00:23:49,33 --> 00:23:51,58
This comes from this v ^ -2.

383
00:23:51,58 --> 00:23:54,73
And then the second
term is - u v'.

384
00:23:54,73 --> 00:23:57,25

385
00:23:57,25 --> 00:24:00,15
And the first term, we have to
multiply by an extra factor of

386
00:24:00,15 --> 00:24:02,19
v, because we have a v^2
in the denominator.

387
00:24:02,19 --> 00:24:04,32
So it's u'v.

388
00:24:04,32 --> 00:24:08,11
All right, so this is the
quotient rule as we wrote it

389
00:24:08,11 --> 00:24:11,515
down in lecture, and this is
just another way of remembering

390
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,85
it or deriving it without
remembering it, if you just

391
00:24:13,85 --> 00:24:16,7
remember the chain rule
and the product rule.

392
00:24:16,7 --> 00:24:21,46
Okay, so you'll find that in
many contexts, it's easier

393
00:24:21,46 --> 00:24:25,91
to do one or the other.

394
00:24:25,91 --> 00:24:29,21
Okay, so now i'm ready to
differentiate the secant

395
00:24:29,21 --> 00:24:30,99
and a few such functions.

396
00:24:30,99 --> 00:24:36,2
So we'll do some
examples here here.

397
00:24:36,2 --> 00:24:40,42
So here's the secant function,
and I want to use that formula

398
00:24:40,42 --> 00:24:44,82
up there for the reciprocal.

399
00:24:44,82 --> 00:24:48,09
This is the way I think of it.

400
00:24:48,09 --> 00:24:53,15
This is the cos x ^ -1.

401
00:24:53,15 --> 00:24:58,75
And so, the formula
here is just what?

402
00:24:58,75 --> 00:25:04,03
It's just - (cos
x) ^ -2 (-sin x).

403
00:25:04,03 --> 00:25:20,28

404
00:25:20,28 --> 00:25:22,69
So now this is usually written
in a different fashion, so

405
00:25:22,69 --> 00:25:25,17
that's why I'm doing this
for a reason actually.

406
00:25:25,17 --> 00:25:27,81
Which is although there are
several formulas for things,

407
00:25:27,81 --> 00:25:30,51
with trig functions, there
are usually five ways

408
00:25:30,51 --> 00:25:31,87
of writing something.

409
00:25:31,87 --> 00:25:34,43
So I'm writing this one down so
that you know what the standard

410
00:25:34,43 --> 00:25:36,78
way of presenting it is.

411
00:25:36,78 --> 00:25:39,43
So what happens here is
that we have two minus

412
00:25:39,43 --> 00:25:40,3
signs cancelling.

413
00:25:40,3 --> 00:25:44,36
And we get sin x / cos^2 x.

414
00:25:44,36 --> 00:25:48,1
That's a perfectly acceptable
answer, but there's a customary

415
00:25:48,1 --> 00:25:49,47
way in which is written.

416
00:25:49,47 --> 00:25:55,89
It's written (1 / cos
x) (sin x / cos x).

417
00:25:55,89 --> 00:25:58,32
And then we get rid of the
denominators by rewriting

418
00:25:58,32 --> 00:26:04,1
it in terms of secant and
tangent, so sec x tan x.

419
00:26:04,1 --> 00:26:09,63
So this is the form that's
generally used when

420
00:26:09,63 --> 00:26:11,79
you see these formulas
written in textbooks.

421
00:26:11,79 --> 00:26:15,04
And so you know, you need to
watch out, because if you ever

422
00:26:15,04 --> 00:26:18,64
want to use this kind of
Calculus, you'll have not

423
00:26:18,64 --> 00:26:22,84
be put off by all the
secants and tangents.

424
00:26:22,84 --> 00:26:27,27
All right, so getting slightly
more complicated, how about if

425
00:26:27,27 --> 00:26:28,75
we differentiate ln(sec x)?

426
00:26:28,75 --> 00:26:37,4

427
00:26:37,4 --> 00:26:40,48
If you differentiate the
natural log, that's just going

428
00:26:40,48 --> 00:26:49,45
to be (sec x)' / sec x.

429
00:26:49,45 --> 00:26:52,46
And plugging in the formula
that we had before, that's

430
00:26:52,46 --> 00:27:00,33
(sec x) (tan x) / sec
x, which is tan x.

431
00:27:00,33 --> 00:27:03,85
So this one also has
a very nice form.

432
00:27:03,85 --> 00:27:08,23
And you might say that this is
kind of an ugly function, but

433
00:27:08,23 --> 00:27:14,7
the strange thing is that the
natural log was invented before

434
00:27:14,7 --> 00:27:19,56
the exponential by a guy named
Napier, exactly in order to

435
00:27:19,56 --> 00:27:21,72
evaluate functions like this.

436
00:27:21,72 --> 00:27:24,3
These are the functions
that people cared about

437
00:27:24,3 --> 00:27:28,89
a lot, because they were
used in navigation.

438
00:27:28,89 --> 00:27:32,64
You wanted to multiply
sines and cosines together

439
00:27:32,64 --> 00:27:34,03
to do navigation.

440
00:27:34,03 --> 00:27:38,94
And the multiplication he
encoded using a logarithm.

441
00:27:38,94 --> 00:27:40,71
So these were invented
long before people even

442
00:27:40,71 --> 00:27:42,92
knew about exponents.

443
00:27:42,92 --> 00:27:44,6
And it was a surprise,
actually, that it was

444
00:27:44,6 --> 00:27:46,1
connected to exponents.

445
00:27:46,1 --> 00:27:48,74
So the natural log was invented
before the log base 10 and

446
00:27:48,74 --> 00:27:52,65
everything else, exactly
for this kind of purpose.

447
00:27:52,65 --> 00:27:56,51
Anyway, so this is a nice
function, which was very

448
00:27:56,51 --> 00:28:03,77
important, so that your ships
wouldn't crash into the reef.

449
00:28:03,77 --> 00:28:05,57
Okay, let's continue here.

450
00:28:05,57 --> 00:28:09,175
So there's another kind
of function that I want

451
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,49
to discuss with you.

452
00:28:10,49 --> 00:28:16,59
And these are the kinds in
which there's a choice as to

453
00:28:16,59 --> 00:28:19,38
which of these rules to apply.

454
00:28:19,38 --> 00:28:25,13
And I'll just give a couple
of examples of that.

455
00:28:25,13 --> 00:28:28,786
There usually is a better
and a worse way, so let

456
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:38,43
me illustrate that.

457
00:28:38,43 --> 00:28:41,12
Okay, yet another example.

458
00:28:41,12 --> 00:28:43,83
I hope you've seen
some of these before.

459
00:28:43,83 --> 00:28:45,58
Say (x ^ 10

460
00:28:45,58 --> 00:28:47,28
+ 8x) ^ 6.

461
00:28:47,28 --> 00:28:51,01

462
00:28:51,01 --> 00:28:53,28
So it's a little bit more
complicated than what we had

463
00:28:53,28 --> 00:29:00,33
before, because there were
several more symbols here.

464
00:29:00,33 --> 00:29:03,21
So what should we
do at this point?

465
00:29:03,21 --> 00:29:06,4
There's one choice which I
claim is a bad idea, and

466
00:29:06,4 --> 00:29:10,81
that is to expand this
out to the 6th power.

467
00:29:10,81 --> 00:29:13,53
That's a bad idea,
because it's very long.

468
00:29:13,53 --> 00:29:15,99
And then your answer
will also be very long.

469
00:29:15,99 --> 00:29:19,62
It will fill the entire
exam paper, for instance.

470
00:29:19,62 --> 00:29:20,02
Yeah?

471
00:29:20,02 --> 00:29:21,38
STUDENT: Can you use
the chain rule?

472
00:29:21,38 --> 00:29:21,97
PROFESSOR: Chain rule.

473
00:29:21,97 --> 00:29:22,58
That's it.

474
00:29:22,58 --> 00:29:23,5
We use the chain rule.

475
00:29:23,5 --> 00:29:26,86
So fortunately, this is
relatively easy using

476
00:29:26,86 --> 00:29:27,62
the chain rule.

477
00:29:27,62 --> 00:29:30,79
We just think of this box
as being the function.

478
00:29:30,79 --> 00:29:35,34
And we take 6 times this guy to
the 5th, times the derivative

479
00:29:35,34 --> 00:29:39,38
of this guy, which is 10x ^ 9

480
00:29:39,38 --> 00:29:41,5
8.

481
00:29:41,5 --> 00:29:43,91
And this is, feeling this
in, it's x^10 + 8x.

482
00:29:43,91 --> 00:29:46,14
And that's it.

483
00:29:46,14 --> 00:29:50,27
That's all you need to do
differentiate things like this.

484
00:29:50,27 --> 00:29:55,14
The chain rule is
very effective.

485
00:29:55,14 --> 00:30:00,34
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

486
00:30:00,34 --> 00:30:01,28
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

487
00:30:01,28 --> 00:30:05,83
So I'm not really willing to
answer too many questions about

488
00:30:05,83 --> 00:30:07,5
what's going to be on the exam.

489
00:30:07,5 --> 00:30:10,59
But the question that was just
asked is exactly the kind of

490
00:30:10,59 --> 00:30:13,2
question I'm very
happy to answer.

491
00:30:13,2 --> 00:30:20,09
Ok the question was, in what
form is an acceptable answer?

492
00:30:20,09 --> 00:30:23,56
Now in real life, that is a
really serious question.

493
00:30:23,56 --> 00:30:26,38
When you ask a computer a
question and it gives you

494
00:30:26,38 --> 00:30:31,38
500 million sheets of
printout, it's useless.

495
00:30:31,38 --> 00:30:34,85
And you really care what form
answers are in, and indeed,

496
00:30:34,85 --> 00:30:39
somebody might really care what
this thing to the 6th power is,

497
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42,2
and then you would be forced
to discuss things in terms of

498
00:30:42,2 --> 00:30:46,11
that other functional form.

499
00:30:46,11 --> 00:30:50,41
For the purposes of this
exam, this is okay form.

500
00:30:50,41 --> 00:30:54,49
And, in fact, any correct
form is an okay form.

501
00:30:54,49 --> 00:30:57,77
I recommend strongly that you
not try to simplify things

502
00:30:57,77 --> 00:30:59,7
unless we tell you to.

503
00:30:59,7 --> 00:31:04,86
Sometimes it will be to your
advantage to simplify things.

504
00:31:04,86 --> 00:31:08,01
Sometimes we'll say simplify.

505
00:31:08,01 --> 00:31:10,92
It takes a good deal of
experience to know when

506
00:31:10,92 --> 00:31:13,34
it's really worth it to
simplify expressions.

507
00:31:13,34 --> 00:31:13,62
Yes?

508
00:31:13,62 --> 00:31:19,53
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

509
00:31:19,53 --> 00:31:23,59
PROFESSOR: Right, so
turning to this example.

510
00:31:23,59 --> 00:31:25,52
The question is what
is this derivative?

511
00:31:25,52 --> 00:31:27,24
And here's an answer.

512
00:31:27,24 --> 00:31:29,5
That's the end of the problem.

513
00:31:29,5 --> 00:31:31,81
This is a more customary form.

514
00:31:31,81 --> 00:31:37,16
But this is answer is ok.

515
00:31:37,16 --> 00:31:38,61
Same issue.

516
00:31:38,61 --> 00:31:40,97
That's exactly the point.

517
00:31:40,97 --> 00:31:41,66
Yes?

518
00:31:41,66 --> 00:31:51,46
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

519
00:31:51,46 --> 00:31:59,41
PROFESSOR: The question is, do
you have to show the work?

520
00:31:59,41 --> 00:32:00,24
Do you have to show the work?

521
00:32:00,24 --> 00:32:05,87
Well if I ask you what is d/dx
of sec x, then if you wrote

522
00:32:05,87 --> 00:32:08,39
down this answer or you wrote
down this answer showing no

523
00:32:08,39 --> 00:32:11,2
work, that would be acceptable.

524
00:32:11,2 --> 00:32:17,05
If the question was derive the
formula for this from the

525
00:32:17,05 --> 00:32:19,25
formula for the derivative of
the cosine or something like

526
00:32:19,25 --> 00:32:21,16
that, then it would
not be acceptable.

527
00:32:21,16 --> 00:32:24,34
You'd have to carry
out this arithmetic.

528
00:32:24,34 --> 00:32:29,28
So, in other words, typically
this will come up, for

529
00:32:29,28 --> 00:32:32,29
instance, in various contexts.

530
00:32:32,29 --> 00:32:35,04
You just basically have
to follow directions.

531
00:32:35,04 --> 00:32:35,33
Yes?

532
00:32:35,33 --> 00:32:41,52
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

533
00:32:41,52 --> 00:32:43,68
PROFESSOR: The next question
is, are you expected to be able

534
00:32:43,68 --> 00:32:46,18
to prove what the derivative
of the sine function is?

535
00:32:46,18 --> 00:32:49,58
The short answer
to that is yes.

536
00:32:49,58 --> 00:32:52,51
But I will be getting to that
when I discuss the rest

537
00:32:52,51 --> 00:32:54,24
of the material here.

538
00:32:54,24 --> 00:32:58,43
We're almost there.

539
00:32:58,43 --> 00:33:02,64
Okay, so let me just
finish these examples

540
00:33:02,64 --> 00:33:04,88
with one last one.

541
00:33:04,88 --> 00:33:09,04
And then we'll talk about this
question of things like the

542
00:33:09,04 --> 00:33:12,06
derivative of the sine
function, and deriving it.

543
00:33:12,06 --> 00:33:15,62
So the last example that I'd
like to write down is the one

544
00:33:15,62 --> 00:33:20,75
that I promised you in the
first lecture, namely to

545
00:33:20,75 --> 00:33:26,57
differentiate e ^ x arctan x.

546
00:33:26,57 --> 00:33:28,38
Basically you're supposed to
be able to differentiate

547
00:33:28,38 --> 00:33:29,35
any function.

548
00:33:29,35 --> 00:33:32,39
So this is the one that we
mentioned at the beginning.

549
00:33:32,39 --> 00:33:34,13
So here it is.

550
00:33:34,13 --> 00:33:37,28
Let's do it.

551
00:33:37,28 --> 00:33:38,17
So what is it?

552
00:33:38,17 --> 00:33:46,15
Well, it's just equal to -
I have to differentiate.

553
00:33:46,15 --> 00:33:51,28
I have to use the chain rule -
it's equal to the exponential

554
00:33:51,28 --> 00:33:58,2
times the derivative of
this expression here.

555
00:33:58,2 --> 00:33:59,26
That's the chain rule.

556
00:33:59,26 --> 00:34:01,7
That's the first step.

557
00:34:01,7 --> 00:34:06,44
And now I have to apply
the product rule here.

558
00:34:06,44 --> 00:34:10,82
So I have e ^ x arctan x.

559
00:34:10,82 --> 00:34:16,12
And I differentiate the first
factor, so I get arctan x.

560
00:34:16,12 --> 00:34:18,01
Add to it what happens when
I differentiate the second

561
00:34:18,01 --> 00:34:19,67
factor, leaving alone the x.

562
00:34:19,67 --> 00:34:21,64
So that's x / 1

563
00:34:21,64 --> 00:34:24,31
x^2.

564
00:34:24,31 --> 00:34:26,3
And that's it.

565
00:34:26,3 --> 00:34:28,78
That's the end of the problem.

566
00:34:28,78 --> 00:34:30,59
It wasn't that hard.

567
00:34:30,59 --> 00:34:35,56
Of course, it requires you to
remember all of the rules, and

568
00:34:35,56 --> 00:34:37,3
a lot of formulas
underlying them.

569
00:34:37,3 --> 00:34:39,56
So that's consistent with
what I just told you.

570
00:34:39,56 --> 00:34:42,06
I told you that you
wanted to know this.

571
00:34:42,06 --> 00:34:44,74
I told you that you needed
to know this product rule,

572
00:34:44,74 --> 00:34:50,61
and that you needed to
know the chain rule.

573
00:34:50,61 --> 00:34:53,086
And I guess there was one more
thing, the derivative of e to

574
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:55,26
the x came into play there.

575
00:34:55,26 --> 00:34:59,17
So of these formulas, we
used four of them in

576
00:34:59,17 --> 00:35:03,81
this one calculation.

577
00:35:03,81 --> 00:35:15,88
Okay, so now what other things
did we talk about in Unit One?

578
00:35:15,88 --> 00:35:25,18
So the main other thing that
we talked about was the

579
00:35:25,18 --> 00:35:33,12
definition of a derivative.

580
00:35:33,12 --> 00:35:42,46
And also there was sort of a
goal which was to get to the

581
00:35:42,46 --> 00:35:51,05
meaning of the derivative.

582
00:35:51,05 --> 00:35:56,75
So these are things - so we had
a couple of ways of looking at

583
00:35:56,75 --> 00:35:59,4
it, or at least a couple
that I'm going to

584
00:35:59,4 --> 00:36:01,78
emphasize right now.

585
00:36:01,78 --> 00:36:06,27
But first, let me remind
you what the formula is.

586
00:36:06,27 --> 00:36:13,9
The derivative is the limit as
delta x goes to 0 of (f(x

587
00:36:13,9 --> 00:36:19,04
delta x) - f(x)) / delta x.

588
00:36:19,04 --> 00:36:22,76
So that's it, and this is
certainly going to be

589
00:36:22,76 --> 00:36:25,64
a central focus here.

590
00:36:25,64 --> 00:36:29,6
And you want to be able to
recognize this formula

591
00:36:29,6 --> 00:36:42,76
in a number of ways.

592
00:36:42,76 --> 00:36:44,52
So, how do we use this?

593
00:36:44,52 --> 00:36:50,56
Well one thing we did was
we calculated a bunch of

594
00:36:50,56 --> 00:36:51,45
these rates of change.

595
00:36:51,45 --> 00:36:53,66
In fact, more or less,
they're the ones which are

596
00:36:53,66 --> 00:36:55,76
written right over here.

597
00:36:55,76 --> 00:36:57,21
This list of functions here.

598
00:36:57,21 --> 00:37:01,47
Now, which ones did we start
out with just straight

599
00:37:01,47 --> 00:37:03,8
from the definition here?

600
00:37:03,8 --> 00:37:04,84
Which of these things?

601
00:37:04,84 --> 00:37:05,83
There were a whole
bunch of them.

602
00:37:05,83 --> 00:37:09,18
So we started out with
a function 1 / x.

603
00:37:09,18 --> 00:37:11,53
We did x^n.

604
00:37:11,53 --> 00:37:14,53
We did sine x.

605
00:37:14,53 --> 00:37:16,88
We did cosine x.

606
00:37:16,88 --> 00:37:18,89
Now there was a little
bit of subtlety with

607
00:37:18,89 --> 00:37:21,11
sine x and cosine x.

608
00:37:21,11 --> 00:37:25,21
We got them using
something else.

609
00:37:25,21 --> 00:37:26,88
We didn't quite get
them all the way.

610
00:37:26,88 --> 00:37:31,79
We got them using
the case x = 0.

611
00:37:31,79 --> 00:37:35,59
We got them from the derivative
at x = 0, we got the formulas

612
00:37:35,59 --> 00:37:37,68
for the derivatives
of sine and cosine.

613
00:37:37,68 --> 00:37:41,48
But that was an argument which
involved plug in sine x

614
00:37:41,48 --> 00:37:44,46
delta x, and running through.

615
00:37:44,46 --> 00:37:45,84
So that's one example.

616
00:37:45,84 --> 00:37:50,63
We also did a ^ x.

617
00:37:50,63 --> 00:37:53,27
And that may be it.

618
00:37:53,27 --> 00:37:58,35
Oh yeah, I think
that's about it.

619
00:37:58,35 --> 00:38:00,75
That may be about it.

620
00:38:00,75 --> 00:38:00,95
No.

621
00:38:00,95 --> 00:38:01,62
It isn't.

622
00:38:01,62 --> 00:38:04,62
Ok, so let me make a connection
here which you probably haven't

623
00:38:04,62 --> 00:38:07,77
yet made, which is that
we did it for (u v)'.

624
00:38:07,77 --> 00:38:10,52

625
00:38:10,52 --> 00:38:15,69
And we also did
it for (u / v)'.

626
00:38:15,69 --> 00:38:18,06
So sorry, I shouldn't write
primes, because that's

627
00:38:18,06 --> 00:38:20,5
not consistent.

628
00:38:20,5 --> 00:38:22,74
I differentiated the product;
I differentiated the

629
00:38:22,74 --> 00:38:28,11
quotient using the
same delta x notation.

630
00:38:28,11 --> 00:38:32,76
I guess I forgot that because I
wasn't there when it happened.

631
00:38:32,76 --> 00:38:36,55
So look, these are the
ones that you do by this.

632
00:38:36,55 --> 00:38:39,31
And, of course, you might have
to reduce them to other things.

633
00:38:39,31 --> 00:38:42,19
These involve using
something else.

634
00:38:42,19 --> 00:38:46,61
This one involves using the
slope of this function at 0,

635
00:38:46,61 --> 00:38:48,6
just the way the sine
and the cosine did.

636
00:38:48,6 --> 00:38:51,25
This one involves the
slopes of the individual

637
00:38:51,25 --> 00:38:53,5
functions, u and v.

638
00:38:53,5 --> 00:38:55,33
And this one also
involves the individual.

639
00:38:55,33 --> 00:38:57,13
So, in other words, it doesn't
get you all the way through to

640
00:38:57,13 --> 00:39:01,17
the end, but it's expressed in
terms of something simpler

641
00:39:01,17 --> 00:39:03,01
in each of these cases.

642
00:39:03,01 --> 00:39:05,84
And I could go on.

643
00:39:05,84 --> 00:39:09,69
We didn't do these in class,
but you're certainly... e ^ x

644
00:39:09,69 --> 00:39:12,17
is a perfectly okay one
on one of the exams.

645
00:39:12,17 --> 00:39:14,97
We ask you for 1 / x^2.

646
00:39:14,97 --> 00:39:16,58
In other words, I'm not
claiming that it's going to

647
00:39:16,58 --> 00:39:18,8
be one on this list, but
it certainly can be

648
00:39:18,8 --> 00:39:19,86
any one of these.

649
00:39:19,86 --> 00:39:21,86
But we're not going to ask you
to go all the way through to

650
00:39:21,86 --> 00:39:26,38
the beginning in
these formulas.

651
00:39:26,38 --> 00:39:28,94
There are also some fundamental
limits that I certainly

652
00:39:28,94 --> 00:39:31,21
want you to know about.

653
00:39:31,21 --> 00:39:34,68
And these you can
derive in reverse.

654
00:39:34,68 --> 00:39:58,88
So I will describe that now.

655
00:39:58,88 --> 00:40:06,91
So let me also emphasize the
following thing: I want to

656
00:40:06,91 --> 00:40:18,59
read this backwards now.

657
00:40:18,59 --> 00:40:21,37
This is the theme from the very
beginning of this lecture.

658
00:40:21,37 --> 00:40:25,6
Namely, if you're given
the function f, you can

659
00:40:25,6 --> 00:40:28,31
figure out its derivative
by its formula here.

660
00:40:28,31 --> 00:40:29,86
That is the formula for
this in terms of what's

661
00:40:29,86 --> 00:40:30,92
on the right hand side.

662
00:40:30,92 --> 00:40:35,41
On the other hand, you can
also use the formula in that

663
00:40:35,41 --> 00:40:47,91
direction, and if you know the
slope of something, you can

664
00:40:47,91 --> 00:40:49,17
figure out what the limit is.

665
00:40:49,17 --> 00:40:54,79
For example, I'll use
the letter x here, even

666
00:40:54,79 --> 00:40:56,04
though it's cheating.

667
00:40:56,04 --> 00:40:59,53
Maybe I'll call it delta x
so it's clearer to you.

668
00:40:59,53 --> 00:41:06,9
Maybe I'll call it u.

669
00:41:06,9 --> 00:41:10,37
Suppose you look at
this limit here.

670
00:41:10,37 --> 00:41:15,25
Well, I claim that you should
recognize that is the

671
00:41:15,25 --> 00:41:19,06
derivative with respect to u
of the function e^u at u =

672
00:41:19,06 --> 00:41:22,66
0, which of course
we know to be 1.

673
00:41:22,66 --> 00:41:25,42
So this is reading this
formula in reverse.

674
00:41:25,42 --> 00:41:28,55
It's recognizing that one of
these limits - let me rewrite

675
00:41:28,55 --> 00:41:35,99
this again here - one of these
so-called difference quotient

676
00:41:35,99 --> 00:41:39,39
limits is a derivative.

677
00:41:39,39 --> 00:41:42,19
And since we know a formula
for that derivative,

678
00:41:42,19 --> 00:41:49,94
we can evaluate it.

679
00:41:49,94 --> 00:41:54,77
And lastly, there's one
other type of thing which

680
00:41:54,77 --> 00:41:57,55
I think you should know.

681
00:41:57,55 --> 00:41:59,78
These are the ones you do
with difference quotients.

682
00:41:59,78 --> 00:42:01,59
There are also other
formulas that you want

683
00:42:01,59 --> 00:42:03
to be able to drive.

684
00:42:03 --> 00:42:20,89
You want to be able to
derive formulas by

685
00:42:20,89 --> 00:42:27,67
implicit differentiation.

686
00:42:27,67 --> 00:42:31,73
In other words, the basic idea
is to take whatever equation

687
00:42:31,73 --> 00:42:37,2
you've got and simplify it as
much as possible, without

688
00:42:37,2 --> 00:42:41,26
insisting that you solve for y.

689
00:42:41,26 --> 00:42:44,18
That's not necessarily the
most appropriate way to

690
00:42:44,18 --> 00:42:45,63
get the rate of change.

691
00:42:45,63 --> 00:42:51,91
The much simpler
formula is sin y = x.

692
00:42:51,91 --> 00:42:59,78
And that one is easier to
differentiate implicitly.

693
00:42:59,78 --> 00:43:02,9
So I should say, do
this kind of thing.

694
00:43:02,9 --> 00:43:05,55
So that's, if you like,
a typical derivation

695
00:43:05,55 --> 00:43:08,39
that you might see.

696
00:43:08,39 --> 00:43:13,07
And then there's one last type
of problem that you'll face,

697
00:43:13,07 --> 00:43:21,59
and it's the other thing
that I claim we discussed.

698
00:43:21,59 --> 00:43:26,58
And it goes all the way
back to the first lecture.

699
00:43:26,58 --> 00:43:34,05
So the last thing that we'll be
talking about is tangent lines.

700
00:43:34,05 --> 00:43:34,2
All right?

701
00:43:34,2 --> 00:43:38,76
The geometric point of
view of a derivative.

702
00:43:38,76 --> 00:43:41,9
And we'll be doing more of
this in next the unit.

703
00:43:41,9 --> 00:43:45,41
So first of all, you'll be
expected to be able to

704
00:43:45,41 --> 00:43:52,38
compute the tangent line.

705
00:43:52,38 --> 00:43:56,4
That's often fairly
straightforward.

706
00:43:56,4 --> 00:44:03,59
And the second thing is to
graph y' , the derivative

707
00:44:03,59 --> 00:44:07,37
of a function.

708
00:44:07,37 --> 00:44:10,44
And the third thing, which I'm
going to throw in here, because

709
00:44:10,44 --> 00:44:14,72
I regard it in a sort of
geometric vein, although it's

710
00:44:14,72 --> 00:44:16,69
got an analytical aspect to it.

711
00:44:16,69 --> 00:44:18,87
So this is a picture.

712
00:44:18,87 --> 00:44:20,71
This is a computation.

713
00:44:20,71 --> 00:44:23,33
And if you combine the
two together, you

714
00:44:23,33 --> 00:44:24,27
get something else.

715
00:44:24,27 --> 00:44:37,87
And so this is to recognize
differentiable functions.

716
00:44:37,87 --> 00:44:40,19
Alright, so how do you do this?

717
00:44:40,19 --> 00:44:43,6
Well, we really only have
one way of doing it.

718
00:44:43,6 --> 00:44:54,58
We're going to check the
left and right tangents.

719
00:44:54,58 --> 00:44:59,45
They must be equal.

720
00:44:59,45 --> 00:45:05
So again, this is a property
that you should be familiar

721
00:45:05 --> 00:45:06,83
with from some of
your exercises.

722
00:45:06,83 --> 00:45:09,9
And the idea is simply, that if
the tangent line exists, it's

723
00:45:09,9 --> 00:45:14,77
the same from the right
and from the left.

724
00:45:14,77 --> 00:45:21,94
Ok, now I'm going to just do
one example here from this sort

725
00:45:21,94 --> 00:45:27,76
of qualitative sketching skill
to give you an example here.

726
00:45:27,76 --> 00:45:30,58
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to draw a graph

727
00:45:30,58 --> 00:45:34,75
of a function like this.

728
00:45:34,75 --> 00:45:38,58
And what I want to do
underneath is draw the

729
00:45:38,58 --> 00:45:41,6
graph of the derivative.

730
00:45:41,6 --> 00:45:46,6
So this is the function y =
f(x), and here I'm going to

731
00:45:46,6 --> 00:45:56,49
draw the graph of the function
y = f'(x) right underneath it.

732
00:45:56,49 --> 00:46:00,33
So now, let's think about what
it's supposed to look like.

733
00:46:00,33 --> 00:46:06,09
And the one step that you need
to make in order to do this, is

734
00:46:06,09 --> 00:46:08,66
to draw a few tangent lines.

735
00:46:08,66 --> 00:46:13,21
I'm just going to
draw one down here.

736
00:46:13,21 --> 00:46:18,73
And I'm going to
draw one up here.

737
00:46:18,73 --> 00:46:23,78
Now, the tangent lines here -
noticed that the slope of these

738
00:46:23,78 --> 00:46:27,3
tangent lines are all positive.

739
00:46:27,3 --> 00:46:31,8
So everything I draw down
here is going to be

740
00:46:31,8 --> 00:46:33,88
above the x-axis.

741
00:46:33,88 --> 00:46:36,58
Furthermore,, as I go further
to the left, they get

742
00:46:36,58 --> 00:46:37,83
steeper and steeper.

743
00:46:37,83 --> 00:46:39,5
So they're getting
higher and higher.

744
00:46:39,5 --> 00:46:44,02
So the function is
coming down like this.

745
00:46:44,02 --> 00:46:45,35
It starts up there.

746
00:46:45,35 --> 00:46:50,57
Maybe I'll draw it in green to
illustrate the graph here.

747
00:46:50,57 --> 00:46:56,91
So that's this function here.

748
00:46:56,91 --> 00:46:59,75
As we get farther out, it's
getting flatter and flatter.

749
00:46:59,75 --> 00:47:06,27
So it's leveling off, but
above the axis like that.

750
00:47:06,27 --> 00:47:09,52
So one of the things to
emphasize is, you should not

751
00:47:09,52 --> 00:47:12,09
expect the derivative to
look like the function.

752
00:47:12,09 --> 00:47:13,32
It's totally different.

753
00:47:13,32 --> 00:47:17,42
It's keeping track at each
point of its tangent line.

754
00:47:17,42 --> 00:47:19,78
On the other hand, you should
get some kind of physical feel

755
00:47:19,78 --> 00:47:23,67
for it, and we'll be practicing
this more in the next unit.

756
00:47:23,67 --> 00:47:25,5
So let me give you an
example of a function

757
00:47:25,5 --> 00:47:27,8
which does exactly this.

758
00:47:27,8 --> 00:47:33,24
And it's the function y = ln x.

759
00:47:33,24 --> 00:47:38,56
If you differentiate it,
you get y' = 1 / x.

760
00:47:38,56 --> 00:47:44,63
And this plot above is, roughly
speaking, the logarithm.

761
00:47:44,63 --> 00:47:50,23
And this plot underneath
is the function 1 / x.

762
00:47:50,23 --> 00:47:53,23
We still have time
for one question.

763
00:47:53,23 --> 00:47:58,58
And so, fire away.

764
00:47:58,58 --> 00:48:03,67
Yes?

765
00:48:03,67 --> 00:48:04,04
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

766
00:48:04,04 --> 00:48:06,75
PROFESSOR: The question is,
can you show how you derive

767
00:48:06,75 --> 00:48:09,77
the inverse tangent of x.

768
00:48:09,77 --> 00:48:13,35
So that's in a lecture.

769
00:48:13,35 --> 00:48:17,78
I'm happy to do it right
now, but it's going to make

770
00:48:17,78 --> 00:48:20,42
me a whole two minutes.

771
00:48:20,42 --> 00:48:27,56
So, here's how you do
it. y = arctan x.

772
00:48:27,56 --> 00:48:30,77
And now this is hopeless
to differentiate, so I

773
00:48:30,77 --> 00:48:34,72
rewrite it as tan y = x.

774
00:48:34,72 --> 00:48:38,44
And now I have to
differentiate that.

775
00:48:38,44 --> 00:48:43,67
So when I differentiate it, I
get the derivative of tan y

776
00:48:43,67 --> 00:48:46,56
with respect to x, so
with respect to y.

777
00:48:46,56 --> 00:48:47,76
That's (1 / 1

778
00:48:47,76 --> 00:48:48,21
y^2 )y'.

779
00:48:48,21 --> 00:48:51,12

780
00:48:51,12 --> 00:48:52,85
So this is a hard step.

781
00:48:52,85 --> 00:48:53,93
That's the chain rule.

782
00:48:53,93 --> 00:48:55,86
And on the left side I get 1.

783
00:48:55,86 --> 00:48:58,73
So I'm doing this super
fast because we have

784
00:48:58,73 --> 00:49:00,72
thirty seconds left.

785
00:49:00,72 --> 00:49:02,84
But this is the hard
step right here.

786
00:49:02,84 --> 00:49:22,81
And it needs for you to know
that d/dy (tan y) = sec^2 y.

787
00:49:22,81 --> 00:49:24,92
So here's the identity.

788
00:49:24,92 --> 00:49:28,5
So you need have known
this in advance.

789
00:49:28,5 --> 00:49:30,74
And that's the input
into this equation.

790
00:49:30,74 --> 00:49:44,44
So now, what we have is that
y' = 1 / sec^2 y, which is

791
00:49:44,44 --> 00:49:51,38
the same thing as cos^2 y.

792
00:49:51,38 --> 00:49:54,98
Now, the last bit of the
problem is to rewrite

793
00:49:54,98 --> 00:49:57,93
this in terms of x.

794
00:49:57,93 --> 00:50:02,664
And that you have to do
with a right triangle.

795
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:06,884
If this is x and this is 1,
then the angle is y, because

796
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:09,416
the tangent of y is x.

797
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:14,902
So this expresses the fact
that the tangent of y is x.

798
00:50:14,902 --> 00:50:18,489
And then the hypoteneuse
is the square root of 1

799
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:18,7
x^2.

800
00:50:18,7 --> 00:50:21,654

801
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:27,14
And so the cosine is
1 divided by that.

802
00:50:27,14 --> 00:50:30,305
So this thing is 1 divided
by the square root of 1

803
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:36,424
x^2, the quantity squared.

804
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:40,222
So, and then the last little
bit here, since I'm racing

805
00:50:40,222 --> 00:50:44,02
along, is that it's 1 / 1
+ x^2, squared, which I

806
00:50:44,02 --> 00:50:46,13
incorrectly wrote over here.

807
00:50:46,13 --> 00:50:48,662
OK, so good luck on the text.

808
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:50,806
See you tomorrow.

809
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,17
