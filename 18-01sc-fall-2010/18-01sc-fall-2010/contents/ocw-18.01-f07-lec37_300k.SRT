9
00:00:21,57 --> 00:00:23,04
PROFESSOR: Today we
are continuing with

10
00:00:23,04 --> 00:00:23,71
improper integrals.


11
00:00:24,73 --> 00:00:27,371
I still have a little bit
more to tell you about them.

12
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:30,08



13
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:33,51
What we were discussing at
the very end of last time

14
00:00:33,51 --> 00:00:36,195
was improper integrals.


15
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:41,56



16
00:00:41,56 --> 00:00:44,57
Now and these are going
to be improper integrals

17
00:00:44,57 --> 00:00:45,95
of the second kind.


18
00:00:48,22 --> 00:00:50,99
By second kind I mean if
they have a singularity

19
00:00:50,99 --> 00:00:52,095
at a finite place.


20
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,8



21
00:00:54,8 --> 00:00:56,24
That would be
something like this.

22
00:00:57,26 --> 00:00:59,286
So here's the definition
if you like.

23
00:01:00,14 --> 00:01:03,38
Same sort of thing as we
did when the singularity

24
00:01:03,38 --> 00:01:04,12
was an infinity.


25
00:01:04,12 --> 00:01:07,29
So if you have the integral
from 0 to 1 of f of x.

26
00:01:09,44 --> 00:01:11,4
This is going to be the
same thing as the limit.

27
00:01:12,6 --> 00:01:14,856
As a goes to 0 from above.


28
00:01:15,79 --> 00:01:19,16
The integral from 8
to 1 of f of x d x.

29
00:01:21,15 --> 00:01:25,63
The idea here is the same one
that we had at infinity.

30
00:01:25,92 --> 00:01:27,32
Let me draw a picture of it.


31
00:01:27,32 --> 00:01:29,82
You have imagine a function
which is coming down like

32
00:01:29,82 --> 00:01:31,26
this and here's the point 1.


33
00:01:32,02 --> 00:01:35,63
And we don't know whether the
area enclosed is going to be

34
00:01:35,63 --> 00:01:40,255
infinite or finite until we
cut it off at someplace a.

35
00:01:40,68 --> 00:01:43,68
And we let a go
to 0 from above.

36
00:01:44,22 --> 00:01:46
So really it's 0 plus.


37
00:01:46,8 --> 00:01:49,133
So we're coming in
from the right here.

38
00:01:49,82 --> 00:01:52,08
And we're counting up
the area in this chunk.

39
00:01:52,81 --> 00:01:56,79
And we're seeing as it expands
whether it goes to infinity or

40
00:01:56,79 --> 00:01:58,67
whether it tends to
some finite limit.

41
00:01:59,29 --> 00:02:02,25
Right so this is the example
and this is the definition.

42
00:02:02,99 --> 00:02:06,42
And just as we did for the
other kind of improper

43
00:02:06,42 --> 00:02:11,86
integral, we say that this
converges-- so that's the key

44
00:02:11,86 --> 00:02:21,36
word here --if the limit is
finite, exists maybe I should

45
00:02:21,36 --> 00:02:26,39
just say and diverges if not.


46
00:02:26,39 --> 00:02:35,65



47
00:02:35,65 --> 00:02:38,945
Let's just take care of
the basic examples.

48
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:42,11



49
00:02:42,11 --> 00:02:44,74
First of all I wrote this
one down last time.

50
00:02:44,74 --> 00:02:46,96
We're going to
evaluate this one.

51
00:02:47,39 --> 00:02:51,565
The integral from 0 to 1 of 1
over the square root of x.

52
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:55,74



53
00:02:55,74 --> 00:02:58,65
You almost don't notice the
fact that it goes to infinity.

54
00:02:59,92 --> 00:03:01,995
This goes to infinity
as x goes to 0.

55
00:03:02,57 --> 00:03:05,45
But if you evaluate it --
first of all we always

56
00:03:05,45 --> 00:03:06,445
write this as a power.


57
00:03:06,86 --> 00:03:07,19
Right?


58
00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:09,03
To get evaluation.


59
00:03:09,87 --> 00:03:13,06
And then I'm not even going
to replace the 0 by an a.

60
00:03:13,06 --> 00:03:14,49
I'm just going to
leave it as 0.

61
00:03:14,49 --> 00:03:18,66
The antiderivative here
is x to the 1/2 times 2.

62
00:03:18,66 --> 00:03:21,54



63
00:03:21,54 --> 00:03:23,75
And then I evaluate
that at 0 and 1.

64
00:03:23,75 --> 00:03:25,08
And I get 2.


65
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:27,13
2 minus 0, which is 2.


66
00:03:29,09 --> 00:03:30,443
All right so this
one is convergent.

67
00:03:31,33 --> 00:03:34,18
And not only is it convergent
but we can evaluate it.

68
00:03:34,18 --> 00:03:38,31



69
00:03:38,31 --> 00:03:42,94
The second example being not
systematic but really giving

70
00:03:42,94 --> 00:03:45,27
you the principal examples
that we'll be thinking about.

71
00:03:46,99 --> 00:03:53,92
Is this one here d x over x
And this one gives you the

72
00:03:53,92 --> 00:03:55,03
antiderivative as
the logarithm.

73
00:03:56,07 --> 00:03:57,56
Valuated at 0 and 1.


74
00:03:58,18 --> 00:04:00,91
And now again you have to have
this thought process in your

75
00:04:00,91 --> 00:04:02,385
mind that your really
taking the limit.

76
00:04:02,77 --> 00:04:06,44
But this is going to be the
log of 1 minus the log of 0.

77
00:04:06,44 --> 00:04:07,83
Really the log of 0 from above.


78
00:04:07,83 --> 00:04:10,195
There is no such thing as
the log 0 from below.

79
00:04:10,97 --> 00:04:12,52
And this is minus infinity.


80
00:04:12,82 --> 00:04:16,969
So it's 0 minus minus infinity,
which is plus infinity.

81
00:04:19,02 --> 00:04:20,213
And so this one diverges.


82
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:29,71



83
00:04:29,71 --> 00:04:31,685
All right so what's
the general?

84
00:04:32,75 --> 00:04:40,41
So more or less in general for
powers anyway, if you work out

85
00:04:40,41 --> 00:04:44,925
this thing for d x over
x to the p from 0 to 1.

86
00:04:45,22 --> 00:04:49,39
What you're going to find is
that it's 1 over 1 minus p.

87
00:04:50,15 --> 00:04:52,24
When p is less than one.


88
00:04:53,02 --> 00:05:00,24
And it diverges for p
bigger than or equal to 1.

89
00:05:00,24 --> 00:05:02,75



90
00:05:02,75 --> 00:05:04,64
Now that's the final result.


91
00:05:05,31 --> 00:05:09,75
If you carry out this
integration it's not difficult.

92
00:05:10,92 --> 00:05:15,17
All right so now I just
want to try to help

93
00:05:15,17 --> 00:05:16,55
you to remember this.


94
00:05:17,27 --> 00:05:20,5
And to think about how you
should think about it.

95
00:05:20,5 --> 00:05:22,84
So I'm going to say it
in a few more ways.

96
00:05:23,89 --> 00:05:28,22
All right just repeat what I've
said already but try to get it

97
00:05:28,22 --> 00:05:31,535
to percolate and absorb itself.


98
00:05:32,02 --> 00:05:36,19
And in order to do that I have
to make the contrast between

99
00:05:36,19 --> 00:05:38,99
the kind of improper integral
that I was dealing with before.

100
00:05:39,41 --> 00:05:43,23
Which was not as x goes to
0 here but as x goes to

101
00:05:43,23 --> 00:05:44,425
infinity, the other side.


102
00:05:45,92 --> 00:05:47,023
Let's make this contrast.


103
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:52,47



104
00:05:52,47 --> 00:05:56,41
First of all, if I look at the
angle that we have been paying

105
00:05:56,41 --> 00:05:57,61
attention to right now.


106
00:05:57,61 --> 00:06:00,58
We've just considered
things like this.

107
00:06:00,58 --> 00:06:01,83
1 over x to the 1 half.


108
00:06:02,52 --> 00:06:06,335
Which is a lot smaller
than one over x.

109
00:06:06,6 --> 00:06:09,245
Which is a lot smaller than
say 1 over x squared.

110
00:06:10,74 --> 00:06:11,725
Which would be another example.


111
00:06:12,05 --> 00:06:14,56
This is as x goes to 0.


112
00:06:14,56 --> 00:06:19,99



113
00:06:19,99 --> 00:06:22,28
So this once the smallest one.


114
00:06:22,28 --> 00:06:23,31
This one next smallest one.


115
00:06:23,31 --> 00:06:24,44
And this one is very large.


116
00:06:26,82 --> 00:06:30,985
On the other hand it goes
the other way at infinity.

117
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:36,67



118
00:06:36,67 --> 00:06:38,12
As x tends to infinity.


119
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,875
All right so try to
keep that in mind.

120
00:06:43,14 --> 00:06:47,91
And now I'm going to put
a little box around

121
00:06:47,91 --> 00:06:49,21
the bad guys here.


122
00:06:50,1 --> 00:06:53,5
This one is divergent.


123
00:06:54,71 --> 00:06:56,555
And this one is divergent.


124
00:06:57,87 --> 00:06:59,62
And this one is divergent.


125
00:06:59,95 --> 00:07:01,02
And this one is divergent.


126
00:07:01,02 --> 00:07:03,51
When the cross over
point is 1 over x.

127
00:07:03,51 --> 00:07:06,19
When we get smaller than
that, we get to things

128
00:07:06,19 --> 00:07:06,9
which are convergent.


129
00:07:07,39 --> 00:07:10,59
When we get smaller than
it on this other scale,

130
00:07:10,59 --> 00:07:11,185
it's convergent.


131
00:07:12,68 --> 00:07:13,995
All right so these
guys are divergent.

132
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:20,3



133
00:07:20,3 --> 00:07:22,81
So they are associated
with divergent integrals.

134
00:07:23,43 --> 00:07:26,39
The functions themselves are
just tending towards-- well

135
00:07:26,39 --> 00:07:28,96
these tend to infinity,
and these tend toward 0.

136
00:07:29,31 --> 00:07:33,83
So I'm not talking about
the functions themselves

137
00:07:33,83 --> 00:07:34,49
but the integrals.


138
00:07:35,19 --> 00:07:40,04
Now I want to draw this again
here, not small enough.

139
00:07:40,04 --> 00:07:43,81



140
00:07:43,81 --> 00:07:44,84
I want to try this again.


141
00:07:44,84 --> 00:07:48,98



142
00:07:48,98 --> 00:07:50,8
So I'm just going to draw
a picture of what it

143
00:07:50,8 --> 00:07:51,76
is that I have here.


144
00:07:51,76 --> 00:07:53,39
But I'm going to combine
these two pictures.

145
00:07:54,85 --> 00:08:01,63
So here's the picture for
example of y equals 1 over x.

146
00:08:01,63 --> 00:08:04,714



147
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:05,65
All right.


148
00:08:06,7 --> 00:08:08,03
That's y equals 1 over x.


149
00:08:08,77 --> 00:08:10,215
And that picture
is very balanced.

150
00:08:10,47 --> 00:08:12,13
It's symmetric on the two ends.


151
00:08:12,6 --> 00:08:17,325
If I cut it in half then what
I get here is 2 halves.

152
00:08:17,66 --> 00:08:21,7
And this one has
an infinite area.

153
00:08:23,7 --> 00:08:26,75
That corresponds to the
integral from 1 to infinity,

154
00:08:26,75 --> 00:08:29,43
d x over x being infinite.


155
00:08:30,53 --> 00:08:33,82
And the other piece--
which this one we

156
00:08:33,82 --> 00:08:35,31
calculated last time.


157
00:08:35,31 --> 00:08:37,85
This is the one that we just
calculated over here at example

158
00:08:37,85 --> 00:08:42,719
2 has the same property.


159
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,586
It's infinite.


160
00:08:45,72 --> 00:08:47,72
And that's the fact that
the integral from 0

161
00:08:47,72 --> 00:08:50,79
to 1 is infinite.


162
00:08:52,1 --> 00:08:54,93
Right we lose on both ends.


163
00:08:56,57 --> 00:09:03,04
On the other hand if I take
something like-- I'm drawing it

164
00:09:03,04 --> 00:09:06,57
the same way but it's really
not the same --y equals 1 over

165
00:09:06,57 --> 00:09:10,705
the square root of x. y equals
one over x to the 1 half.

166
00:09:11,01 --> 00:09:17,62
And if I cut that in half here
then the x to the 1 half is

167
00:09:17,62 --> 00:09:19,4
actually bigger than this guy.


168
00:09:19,89 --> 00:09:21,74
So this piece is infinite.


169
00:09:21,74 --> 00:09:26,83



170
00:09:26,83 --> 00:09:29,81
And this part over here
actually is going to give

171
00:09:29,81 --> 00:09:30,88
us an honest number.


172
00:09:31,31 --> 00:09:33,42
In fact this one is finite.


173
00:09:34,81 --> 00:09:36,55
And we just checked
what the number is.

174
00:09:36,55 --> 00:09:38,34
It actually happens
to have area 2.

175
00:09:38,34 --> 00:09:46,25



176
00:09:46,25 --> 00:09:49,57
And what's happening here is if
you would superimpose this

177
00:09:49,57 --> 00:09:52,34
graph on the other graph what
you would see is

178
00:09:52,34 --> 00:09:53,035
that they cross.


179
00:09:54,58 --> 00:09:58,585
And this one sits on top.


180
00:09:58,97 --> 00:10:04,66
So if I drew this one in let's
have another color here

181
00:10:04,66 --> 00:10:05,84
--orange let's say.


182
00:10:05,84 --> 00:10:08,79
If this were orange if I
set it on top here it

183
00:10:08,79 --> 00:10:10,39
would go this way.


184
00:10:11,13 --> 00:10:13,715
OK and underneath the
orange is still infinite.

185
00:10:14,79 --> 00:10:16,07
So both of these are infinite.


186
00:10:16,07 --> 00:10:18,25
On here on the other hand
underneath the orange is

187
00:10:18,25 --> 00:10:21
infinite but underneath
where the green is finite.

188
00:10:21,7 --> 00:10:22,805
That's a smaller quantity.


189
00:10:23,77 --> 00:10:25,29
Infinity is a lot
bigger than 2.

190
00:10:25,29 --> 00:10:26,68
2 is a lot less than infinity.


191
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,835
All right so that's reflected
in these comparisons here.

192
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:33,12
Now if you like if I want
to do these in green.

193
00:10:33,61 --> 00:10:37,475
This guy good and
this guy is good.

194
00:10:39,9 --> 00:10:42,96
Well let me just repeat that
idea over here in this sort

195
00:10:42,96 --> 00:10:47,176
of reversed picture with y
equals 1 over x squared.

196
00:10:47,93 --> 00:10:52,94
If I chop that in half then the
good part is this end here.

197
00:10:53,64 --> 00:10:54,44
It's finite.


198
00:10:54,44 --> 00:10:56,99



199
00:10:56,99 --> 00:10:59,83
And the bad part is this
part of here which is

200
00:10:59,83 --> 00:11:00,746
way more singular.


201
00:11:01,48 --> 00:11:02,06
And it's infinite.


202
00:11:02,06 --> 00:11:07,07



203
00:11:07,07 --> 00:11:10,75
All right so again what I've
just tried to do is to give

204
00:11:10,75 --> 00:11:18,225
you some geometric sense and
also some visceral sense.

205
00:11:18,58 --> 00:11:22,68
This guy it's tail as it goes
out to infinity is much lower.

206
00:11:23,04 --> 00:11:24,96
It's much smaller
than 1 over x.

207
00:11:25,47 --> 00:11:28,08
And these guys trapped an
infinite amount of area.

208
00:11:28,08 --> 00:11:30,11
This one traps only a
finite amount of area.

209
00:11:30,11 --> 00:11:36,676



210
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:40,88
All right so now I'm just going
to give one last example which

211
00:11:40,88 --> 00:11:43,09
combines these two
types of pictures.

212
00:11:43,09 --> 00:11:45,81
It's really practically
the same as what I said

213
00:11:45,81 --> 00:11:53,32
before but I-- oh have
to erase this one too.

214
00:11:53,32 --> 00:12:01,34



215
00:12:01,34 --> 00:12:07,16
So here's another example
if you're in so let's take

216
00:12:07,16 --> 00:12:08,16
the following example.


217
00:12:08,16 --> 00:12:09,96
This is somewhat related
to the first one that

218
00:12:09,96 --> 00:12:11,15
I gave last time.


219
00:12:11,6 --> 00:12:17,99
If you take a function y equals
1 over x minus 3 squared.

220
00:12:18,77 --> 00:12:20,46
And you think about
it's integral.

221
00:12:21,16 --> 00:12:24,61
So let's think about the
integral from 0 to infinity,

222
00:12:24,61 --> 00:12:27,09
d x over x minus 3 squared.


223
00:12:27,09 --> 00:12:28,68
And suppose you were faced
with this integral.

224
00:12:30,42 --> 00:12:33,21
In order to understand what
it's doing you have to pay

225
00:12:33,21 --> 00:12:35,915
attention just two places
where it can go wrong.

226
00:12:36,31 --> 00:12:38,055
We're going to split
into two pieces.

227
00:12:39,53 --> 00:12:44,54
I'm going say break it up
into this one here up to 5,

228
00:12:44,54 --> 00:12:45,39
for the sake of argument.


229
00:12:45,39 --> 00:12:48,09



230
00:12:48,09 --> 00:12:49,715
And say from 5 to infinity.


231
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:53,672



232
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,545
All right.


233
00:12:54,96 --> 00:12:55,965
So these are the two chunks.


234
00:12:56,26 --> 00:12:58,36
Now why did I break it up
into those two pieces?

235
00:12:58,81 --> 00:13:01,89
Because what's happening with
this function is that it's

236
00:13:01,89 --> 00:13:04,43
going up like this at 3.


237
00:13:05,25 --> 00:13:08,47
And so if I look at
the two halves here.

238
00:13:08,47 --> 00:13:10,64
I'm going to draw them again
and I'm going to illustrate

239
00:13:10,64 --> 00:13:15,35
with what colors we've chosen--
which are I guess red and green

240
00:13:15,35 --> 00:13:25,1
--what you'll discover is that
this one here which corresponds

241
00:13:25,1 --> 00:13:29,02
to this piece here is infinite.


242
00:13:30,54 --> 00:13:33,18
And it's infinite because
there's a square in

243
00:13:33,18 --> 00:13:33,59
the denominator.


244
00:13:34,27 --> 00:13:39,19
And as x goes to 3 this
is very much like we

245
00:13:39,19 --> 00:13:40,345
shifted the 3 to 0.


246
00:13:40,67 --> 00:13:42,56
Very much like this 1
over x squared here.

247
00:13:42,56 --> 00:13:43,87
But not in this context.


248
00:13:44,25 --> 00:13:46,33
In the other context where
it's going to infinity.

249
00:13:46,33 --> 00:13:49,46



250
00:13:49,46 --> 00:13:54,32
This is the same as at the
picture directly above with

251
00:13:54,32 --> 00:13:55,79
the infinite part in red.


252
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:58,07
All right.


253
00:13:59,65 --> 00:14:04,5
And this part here
This part is finite.

254
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:05,785
All right.


255
00:14:06,24 --> 00:14:08,96
So since we have an infinite
part plus a finite part

256
00:14:08,96 --> 00:14:13,03
the conclusion is that
this guy converges.

257
00:14:15,07 --> 00:14:18,85
And this one diverges.


258
00:14:18,85 --> 00:14:21,47



259
00:14:21,47 --> 00:14:23,595
But the total
unfortunately diverges.

260
00:14:23,93 --> 00:14:25,76
Right because it's got
1 infinity in it.

261
00:14:25,76 --> 00:14:28,37
So this thing diverges.


262
00:14:28,37 --> 00:14:31,99



263
00:14:31,99 --> 00:14:33,58
And that's what happened
last time when we

264
00:14:33,58 --> 00:14:34,87
got a crazy number.


265
00:14:34,87 --> 00:14:37,105
If you integrated this you
would get some negative number.

266
00:14:37,48 --> 00:14:39,36
If you wrote down the
formulas carelessly.

267
00:14:39,85 --> 00:14:41,92
And the reason is
that the calculation

268
00:14:41,92 --> 00:14:42,63
actually is nonsense.


269
00:14:44,71 --> 00:14:48,59
So you've gotta be aware if you
encounter a singularity in

270
00:14:48,59 --> 00:14:50,43
the middle not to ignore it.


271
00:14:51,84 --> 00:14:52,1
Yeah.


272
00:14:52,1 --> 00:14:52,36
Question.


273
00:14:52,62 --> 00:14:56,43
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]


274
00:14:56,43 --> 00:14:58,25
PROFESSOR: Why do we say that
the whole thing diverges?

275
00:14:59,71 --> 00:15:01,79
The reason why we say that
is the area under the

276
00:15:01,79 --> 00:15:02,89
whole curve is infinite.


277
00:15:03,69 --> 00:15:05,785
It's the sum of this
piece plus this piece.

278
00:15:06,13 --> 00:15:07,62
And so the total is infinite.


279
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:17,37
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]


280
00:15:17,37 --> 00:15:17,99
PROFESSOR: We're stuck.


281
00:15:17,99 --> 00:15:19,27
This is an ill
defined integral.

282
00:15:19,27 --> 00:15:21,72
It's one where you're
red flashing warning

283
00:15:21,72 --> 00:15:22,56
sign should be on.


284
00:15:22,56 --> 00:15:24,04
Because you're not going
to get the right answer

285
00:15:24,04 --> 00:15:24,51
by computing it.


286
00:15:24,51 --> 00:15:25,65
You'll never get an answer.


287
00:15:26,86 --> 00:15:28,84
Similarly you'll never
get an answer with this.

288
00:15:29,23 --> 00:15:30,85
And you will get an
answer with that.

289
00:15:32,73 --> 00:15:33,2
OK?


290
00:15:33,2 --> 00:15:37,22



291
00:15:37,22 --> 00:15:38,23
Yeah another question.


292
00:15:39,64 --> 00:15:45,76
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]


293
00:15:45,76 --> 00:15:49,48
PROFESSOR: So the question is
if you have a little glance at

294
00:15:49,48 --> 00:15:53,03
an integral, how are you going
to decide where you

295
00:15:53,03 --> 00:15:53,77
should be heading?


296
00:15:54,75 --> 00:15:57,395
So I'm going to
answer that orally.

297
00:15:58,28 --> 00:16:03,665
Although you know but I'll
say one little hint here.

298
00:16:04,01 --> 00:16:08,29
So you always have to check x
going to infinity and x going

299
00:16:08,29 --> 00:16:10,485
to minus infinity, if
they're in there.

300
00:16:10,74 --> 00:16:14,81
And you also have to check any
singularity, like x going

301
00:16:14,81 --> 00:16:16,78
to 3 for sure in this case.


302
00:16:16,78 --> 00:16:18,33
You have to pay attention
all the places where

303
00:16:18,33 --> 00:16:19,015
the thing is infinite.


304
00:16:19,35 --> 00:16:21,865
And then you want to focus
in on each one separately.

305
00:16:22,33 --> 00:16:25,16
And decide what's going on it
at that particular place.

306
00:16:26,92 --> 00:16:29,25
When it's a negative power.


307
00:16:29,59 --> 00:16:35,26
So remember d x over x
as x goes to 0 is bad.

308
00:16:36,98 --> 00:16:39,07
And d x over x squared is bad.


309
00:16:39,07 --> 00:16:40,49
D x over x cubed is bad.


310
00:16:40,49 --> 00:16:41,69
All of them are even worse.


311
00:16:42,6 --> 00:16:48,455
So anything of this form is
bad and equals 1, 2, 3.

312
00:16:49,65 --> 00:16:51
These are the red box kind.


313
00:16:51,98 --> 00:16:52,725
All right.


314
00:16:55,03 --> 00:16:58,22
That means that any of the
integrals that we did in

315
00:16:58,22 --> 00:17:01,89
partial fractions which had a
root, which had a factor of

316
00:17:01,89 --> 00:17:04,34
something, the denominator
Those are all divergent

317
00:17:04,34 --> 00:17:05,876
integrals if you cross
the singularly.

318
00:17:06,67 --> 00:17:09,524
Not a single one of them makes
sense across the singularity.

319
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:12,75



320
00:17:12,75 --> 00:17:14,85
If you have square roots and
things like that then you can

321
00:17:14,85 --> 00:17:16,1
repair things like that.


322
00:17:16,1 --> 00:17:18,03
And there's some interesting
examples of that.

323
00:17:18,03 --> 00:17:20,825
Such as with the arc sign
function and so forth.

324
00:17:21,08 --> 00:17:23,784
Where you have an improper
integral which is really OK.

325
00:17:25,94 --> 00:17:26,39
All right.


326
00:17:26,73 --> 00:17:29,21
So that's the best I can do.


327
00:17:29,88 --> 00:17:31,95
It's obviously something
you get experience with.

328
00:17:32,26 --> 00:17:32,74
All right.


329
00:17:34,11 --> 00:17:38,55
Now I'm going to move
on and this is more or

330
00:17:38,55 --> 00:17:40,385
less our last topic.


331
00:17:42,15 --> 00:17:43,84
Yay but not quite.


332
00:17:43,9 --> 00:17:46,73
Well it's our
penultimate topic.

333
00:17:46,73 --> 00:17:48,13
Right because we have
one more lecture.

334
00:17:49,43 --> 00:17:49,85
All right.


335
00:17:52,01 --> 00:17:54,335
So that our next
topic is series.

336
00:17:54,75 --> 00:17:58,415
Now we'll do it in a sort
of a concrete way today.

337
00:17:58,81 --> 00:18:02,775
And then we'll do what are
known as power series tomorrow.

338
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,4



339
00:18:05,4 --> 00:18:06,76
So let me tell you
about series.

340
00:18:06,76 --> 00:18:20,49



341
00:18:20,49 --> 00:18:22,79
Remember we're talking
about infinity and

342
00:18:22,79 --> 00:18:23,687
dealing with infinity.


343
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,82



344
00:18:26,82 --> 00:18:28,73
So we're not just talking
about any old series.

345
00:18:28,73 --> 00:18:30,13
We're talking about
infinite series.

346
00:18:30,13 --> 00:18:32,65



347
00:18:32,65 --> 00:18:37,69
There is one infinite series
which is probably, which is

348
00:18:37,69 --> 00:18:40,96
without question the most
important and useful series.

349
00:18:41,98 --> 00:18:46,15
And that's the geometric series
but I'm going to introduce it

350
00:18:46,15 --> 00:18:48,405
concretely first in
a particular case.

351
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:51,99



352
00:18:51,99 --> 00:18:54,26
If I draw a picture
of this sum.

353
00:18:54,26 --> 00:18:56,13
Which in principle
goes on forever.

354
00:18:56,48 --> 00:18:59,92
You can see that it go
someplace fairly easily by

355
00:18:59,92 --> 00:19:02,31
marking out what's happening
on the number line.

356
00:19:02,73 --> 00:19:05,43
The first step takes
us to 1 from 0.

357
00:19:06,63 --> 00:19:10,075
And then if I add this
half, I get to 3 halves.

358
00:19:11,79 --> 00:19:15,19
Right, so the first step was 1
and the second step was a half.

359
00:19:16,24 --> 00:19:20,51
Now see if I add this quarter
in which is the next piece

360
00:19:20,51 --> 00:19:22,4
then I get some place here.


361
00:19:22,4 --> 00:19:29,12
But what I want to observe is
that I can look at it from

362
00:19:29,12 --> 00:19:29,975
the other point of view.


363
00:19:31,13 --> 00:19:34,44
When I move this quarter I
got half way to 2 here.

364
00:19:36,24 --> 00:19:40,04
I'm putting 2 in green because
I want you to think of it

365
00:19:40,04 --> 00:19:42,64
as being the good kind.


366
00:19:42,95 --> 00:19:43,39
Right.


367
00:19:43,97 --> 00:19:45,075
The kind that has a number.


368
00:19:45,42 --> 00:19:46,66
And not one of the red kind.


369
00:19:47,28 --> 00:19:49,61
We're getting there and
we're almost there.

370
00:19:49,92 --> 00:19:52,62
So the next stage we
get half way again.

371
00:19:52,62 --> 00:19:54,605
That's the eighth and so forth.


372
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:56,49
And eventually we get to 2.


373
00:19:56,49 --> 00:19:59,03
So this sum we
write equals two.

374
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,84
All right that's kind
of a paradox because

375
00:20:02,84 --> 00:20:04,13
we never get to 2.


376
00:20:04,13 --> 00:20:07,74
This is the paradox
that Zeno fussed with.

377
00:20:08,08 --> 00:20:12,265
And his conclusion with
the rabbit and the hare.

378
00:20:12,96 --> 00:20:14,06
Oh no the rabbit
and the tortoise.

379
00:20:14,14 --> 00:20:18,53
Sorry hare chasing-- anyway the
rabbit chasing the tortoise.

380
00:20:18,89 --> 00:20:22,47
His conclusion-- I don't know
if you're aware of this --but

381
00:20:22,47 --> 00:20:23,77
he understood this paradox.


382
00:20:23,77 --> 00:20:25,92
And he said you know it doesn't
look like it ever gets there

383
00:20:25,92 --> 00:20:30,27
because they're infinitely many
time between the time-- you

384
00:20:30,27 --> 00:20:32,9
know that the tortoise is
always behind, always behind,

385
00:20:32,9 --> 00:20:34,12
always behind, always behind.


386
00:20:34,58 --> 00:20:36,97
So therefore it's impossible
that the tortoise

387
00:20:36,97 --> 00:20:38,03
catches up right.


388
00:20:38,71 --> 00:20:40,15
So do you know what
his conclusion was?

389
00:20:41,6 --> 00:20:42,95
Time does not exist.


390
00:20:45,28 --> 00:20:46,825
That was actually
literally his conclusion.

391
00:20:48,26 --> 00:20:49,95
Because he didn't understand
the possibility of a

392
00:20:49,95 --> 00:20:51,03
continuum of time.


393
00:20:51,03 --> 00:20:53,09
Because there were infinitely
many things that happened

394
00:20:53,09 --> 00:20:54,91
before the tortoise caught up.


395
00:20:56,61 --> 00:20:57,79
So that was the reasoning.


396
00:20:57,79 --> 00:21:00,61
I mean it's a long time ago
but you know he didn't

397
00:21:00,61 --> 00:21:01,27
believe in continuum.


398
00:21:02,43 --> 00:21:02,78
All right.


399
00:21:03,48 --> 00:21:06,14
So anyway that's a small point.


400
00:21:06,94 --> 00:21:19,84
Now the general case here of
geometric series is where

401
00:21:19,84 --> 00:21:22,42
I put in a number a
instead of a half here.

402
00:21:22,82 --> 00:21:23,87
So what we had before.


403
00:21:23,87 --> 00:21:26,19
So that's 1 plus a
plus a squared.

404
00:21:26,89 --> 00:21:28,39
Isn't quite the most
general but anyway

405
00:21:28,39 --> 00:21:30,43
I'll write this down.


406
00:21:31,9 --> 00:21:34,72
And your certainly going to
want to remember that the

407
00:21:34,72 --> 00:21:39,03
formula for this in the
limit is 1 over 1 minus a.

408
00:21:39,51 --> 00:21:43,47
And I remind you that there's
only works when the absolute

409
00:21:43,47 --> 00:21:45,4
value is strictly less than 1.


410
00:21:45,81 --> 00:21:47,66
In other words when minus
1 is strictly less

411
00:21:47,66 --> 00:21:48,74
than a is less than 1.


412
00:21:51,13 --> 00:21:53,37
And that's really the issue
that we're going to want

413
00:21:53,37 --> 00:21:54,31
to worry about now.


414
00:21:54,31 --> 00:21:57,45
What we're worrying about is
this notion of convergence.

415
00:21:58,27 --> 00:22:06,13
And what goes wrong when there
isn't convergence, when

416
00:22:06,13 --> 00:22:06,686
there's a divergence.


417
00:22:07,36 --> 00:22:13,22
So let me illustrate
divergence before going on.

418
00:22:13,22 --> 00:22:15,995
And this is what we have
to avoid if we're going

419
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:17,035
to understand series.


420
00:22:18,99 --> 00:22:21,475
So here's an example
when a is equal to 1.

421
00:22:21,89 --> 00:22:25,833
You get 1 plus 1 plus
1 plus et cetera.

422
00:22:26,62 --> 00:22:29,21
And that's equal to
1 over 1 minus 1.

423
00:22:29,99 --> 00:22:32,37
Which is 1 over 0.


424
00:22:32,37 --> 00:22:33,76
So this is not bad.


425
00:22:33,76 --> 00:22:35,13
It's almost right.


426
00:22:35,36 --> 00:22:36,8
It's sort of infinity
equals infinity.

427
00:22:37,75 --> 00:22:40,01
At the edge here we managed
to get something which

428
00:22:40,01 --> 00:22:41,39
is sort of almost right.


429
00:22:42,34 --> 00:22:46,1
But you know it's we don't
consider this to be logically

430
00:22:46,1 --> 00:22:47,54
to make complete sense.


431
00:22:47,54 --> 00:22:52,19
So it's a little dangerous
And so we just say

432
00:22:52,19 --> 00:22:52,79
that it diverges.


433
00:22:52,96 --> 00:22:53,83
And we get rid of this.


434
00:22:54,1 --> 00:22:55,585
So we're still
putting it in red.

435
00:22:55,99 --> 00:22:56,5
All right.


436
00:22:58,54 --> 00:23:00,85
The bad guy here so
this one diverges.

437
00:23:00,85 --> 00:23:04,67



438
00:23:04,67 --> 00:23:11,01
Similarly if I take a equals
minus 1, I get 1 minus 1 plus 1

439
00:23:11,01 --> 00:23:14,78
minus one plus 1 because the
odd and even powers in that

440
00:23:14,78 --> 00:23:16,39
formula alternate sign.


441
00:23:17,27 --> 00:23:19,375
And this bounces
back and forth.

442
00:23:19,75 --> 00:23:21,09
It never settles down.


443
00:23:21,64 --> 00:23:23,295
It starts at 1.


444
00:23:23,56 --> 00:23:25,42
And then it gets down to 0
and then comes back up to

445
00:23:25,42 --> 00:23:27,52
1, down to 0, back up to 1.


446
00:23:28,4 --> 00:23:29,57
It doesn't settle down.


447
00:23:29,57 --> 00:23:30,6
It bounces back and forth.


448
00:23:30,6 --> 00:23:30,7
It oscillates.


449
00:23:31,58 --> 00:23:33,973
On the other hand if you
compare the right hand side.

450
00:23:34,74 --> 00:23:35,98
What's the right hand side?


451
00:23:35,98 --> 00:23:38,23
It's 1 over 1 minus minus 1.


452
00:23:39,73 --> 00:23:40,87
which is a half.


453
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:42,18
All right.


454
00:23:42,46 --> 00:23:44,71
So if you just paid
attention to the formula.

455
00:23:45,12 --> 00:23:47,24
Which is what we were doing
when we integrated without

456
00:23:47,24 --> 00:23:48,52
thinking too hard about this.


457
00:23:49,24 --> 00:23:51,32
You get a number here but
in fact that's wrong.

458
00:23:51,32 --> 00:23:52,83
Actually it's kind of
an interesting number.

459
00:23:52,83 --> 00:23:55,7
It's halfway between
the 2 between 0 1.

460
00:23:56,38 --> 00:23:59,57
So again there's some sort of
vague sense in which this is

461
00:23:59,57 --> 00:24:01,613
trying to be this answer.


462
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:02,575
All right.


463
00:24:04,58 --> 00:24:07,64
It's not so bad but we're still
going to put this in a red box.

464
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:09,59
All right.


465
00:24:10,03 --> 00:24:11,91
because this is what
we called divergence.

466
00:24:12,71 --> 00:24:15,875
So both of these
cases are divergent.

467
00:24:16,13 --> 00:24:19,67
It only really works
when a is less than 1.

468
00:24:20,49 --> 00:24:25,92
I'm going to add one more case
just to see that mathematicians

469
00:24:25,92 --> 00:24:32,02
are slightly curious about
what goes on in other cases.

470
00:24:32,02 --> 00:24:34,89
So this is 1 plus 2
plus 2 squared plus

471
00:24:34,89 --> 00:24:37,255
2 to cube plus etc..


472
00:24:37,57 --> 00:24:41,44
And that should be equal to--
according to this formula

473
00:24:41,44 --> 00:24:43,5
--1 over 1 minus 2.


474
00:24:44,75 --> 00:24:46,25
Which is negative 1.


475
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:49,113
All right.


476
00:24:49,86 --> 00:24:52,74
Now this one it
clearly wrong, right?

477
00:24:53,46 --> 00:24:59,16
This one it's totally Wrong
It certainly diverges.

478
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,37
The left hand side is
obviously infinite.

479
00:25:02,37 --> 00:25:03,79
The right hand side is way off.


480
00:25:04,07 --> 00:25:04,97
It's negative 1.


481
00:25:05,96 --> 00:25:11,33
On the other hand it turns out
actually that mathematicians

482
00:25:11,33 --> 00:25:12,94
have ways of making
sense out of these.

483
00:25:13,36 --> 00:25:15,81
In number theory there's
a strange system where

484
00:25:15,81 --> 00:25:16,795
this is actually true.


485
00:25:18,16 --> 00:25:22,6
And what happens in that system
is that what you have to throw

486
00:25:22,6 --> 00:25:26,31
out is the idea that 0
is less than you 1.

487
00:25:27,05 --> 00:25:29,15
There is no such thing
as negative numbers.

488
00:25:29,98 --> 00:25:31,77
So this number exists.


489
00:25:32,09 --> 00:25:35,7
And it's the additive
inverse of 1.

490
00:25:35,7 --> 00:25:41,37
It has this arithmetic property
but the statement that 1 is

491
00:25:41,37 --> 00:25:42,975
bigger than 0 does
not make sense.

492
00:25:43,33 --> 00:25:45,83
So you have your choice either
this diverges or you have to

493
00:25:45,83 --> 00:25:48,08
throw out something like this.


494
00:25:48,63 --> 00:25:51,12
So that's a very curious
thing in higher mathematics.

495
00:25:51,51 --> 00:25:56,06
Which if you get to number
theory there's fun stuff there.

496
00:25:56,41 --> 00:25:57,21
All right.


497
00:25:58,92 --> 00:26:02,345
OK but for our purposes
these things are all out.

498
00:26:02,74 --> 00:26:03,02
All right.


499
00:26:03,3 --> 00:26:03,72
They're gone.


500
00:26:04,01 --> 00:26:05,16
We're not considering them.


501
00:26:05,16 --> 00:26:08,03
Only a between
negative 1 and 1.

502
00:26:09,55 --> 00:26:10,07
All right.


503
00:26:10,07 --> 00:26:13,91



504
00:26:13,91 --> 00:26:17,76
Now I want to do
something systematic.

505
00:26:18,19 --> 00:26:21,76
And it's more or less on the
lines of the powers that

506
00:26:21,76 --> 00:26:23,09
I'm erasing right now.


507
00:26:23,09 --> 00:26:26,63



508
00:26:26,63 --> 00:26:28,36
I want to tell you
about series.

509
00:26:28,36 --> 00:26:29,985
Which are kind of
borderline convergent.

510
00:26:30,42 --> 00:26:33,93
And then next time when we talk
about powers series we'll come

511
00:26:33,93 --> 00:26:36,08
back to this very important
series which is the

512
00:26:36,08 --> 00:26:37,08
most important one.


513
00:26:37,08 --> 00:26:40,68



514
00:26:40,68 --> 00:26:46,426
So now let's talk about some
series general notations.

515
00:26:47,4 --> 00:26:49,97
And this will help you
with the last bit.

516
00:26:49,97 --> 00:26:53,81



517
00:26:53,81 --> 00:26:56,89
This is going to be pretty
much the same as what we

518
00:26:56,89 --> 00:26:59,12
did for improper integrals.


519
00:27:00,89 --> 00:27:06,12
First of all I'm going to have
capital S N which is the sum of

520
00:27:06,12 --> 00:27:09,38
a n, n equals 0 to capital N.


521
00:27:09,76 --> 00:27:12,22
And this is what we're
calling a partial sum.

522
00:27:12,22 --> 00:27:18,05



523
00:27:18,05 --> 00:27:24,67
And then the full limit which
is capital S, if you like, and

524
00:27:24,67 --> 00:27:30,13
N equals 0 to infinity is just
the limit as N goes to

525
00:27:30,13 --> 00:27:32,01
infinity of the Sn.


526
00:27:32,01 --> 00:27:36,24



527
00:27:36,24 --> 00:27:39,325
And then we have the same kind
of notation that we had before.

528
00:27:39,77 --> 00:27:45,02
Which is there these two
choices which is that

529
00:27:45,02 --> 00:27:45,89
if the limit exists.


530
00:27:45,89 --> 00:27:50,45



531
00:27:50,45 --> 00:27:51,48
That's the green choice.


532
00:27:51,83 --> 00:27:52,76
And we say it converges.


533
00:27:54,46 --> 00:28:00,156
So we say the series converges.


534
00:28:00,83 --> 00:28:06,616
And then the other case which
is limit does not exist.

535
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:10,9



536
00:28:10,9 --> 00:28:12,24
And we can say the
series diverges.

537
00:28:12,24 --> 00:28:20,56



538
00:28:20,56 --> 00:28:21,06
Question.


539
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:26,48
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]


540
00:28:26,48 --> 00:28:28,885
PROFESSOR: The question was
how did I get to this?

541
00:28:29,29 --> 00:28:31,96
And I will do that next time
but in fact of course you've

542
00:28:31,96 --> 00:28:32,885
seen in high school.


543
00:28:33,24 --> 00:28:34,84
Right this a-- Yeah.


544
00:28:35,93 --> 00:28:36,285
Yeah.


545
00:28:36,86 --> 00:28:37,8
We'll do that next time.


546
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42,99
The question was how do we
arrive-- sorry I didn't tell

547
00:28:42,99 --> 00:28:44,62
you the question --the question
was how do we arrive at this

548
00:28:44,62 --> 00:28:46,202
formula on the right
hand side here.

549
00:28:46,59 --> 00:28:48,24
But we'll talk about
that next time.

550
00:28:48,24 --> 00:28:53,06



551
00:28:53,06 --> 00:28:53,54
All right.


552
00:28:54,02 --> 00:29:00,17
So here's the basic definition
and what we're going to

553
00:29:00,17 --> 00:29:01,38
recognize about series.


554
00:29:02,43 --> 00:29:07,53
And I'm going to give you a
few examples and then we'll

555
00:29:07,53 --> 00:29:08,46
do something systematic.


556
00:29:08,46 --> 00:29:12,07



557
00:29:12,07 --> 00:29:15,38
So the first example-- well the
first example is the geometric

558
00:29:15,38 --> 00:29:19,43
series But the first example
that I'm going to discuss now

559
00:29:19,43 --> 00:29:23,39
and in a little bit of detail
is this sum 1 over n squared

560
00:29:23,39 --> 00:29:24,31
N equals 1 to infinity.


561
00:29:24,31 --> 00:29:28,58



562
00:29:28,58 --> 00:29:34,56
It turns out that this series
is very analogous-- and we'll

563
00:29:34,56 --> 00:29:38,89
develop this analogy carefully
--the integral from 1 to

564
00:29:38,89 --> 00:29:41,065
x d x over x squared.


565
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:45,88
And we're going to develop
this analogy in detail

566
00:29:45,88 --> 00:29:46,89
later in this lecture.


567
00:29:47,92 --> 00:29:50,61
And this one is one of the
ones-- so now you have to go

568
00:29:50,61 --> 00:29:52,84
back and actually remember
this is one of the ones you

569
00:29:52,84 --> 00:29:53,79
really want to memorize.


570
00:29:54,51 --> 00:29:56,46
And you should especially
pay attention to the ones

571
00:29:56,46 --> 00:29:57,72
with an infinity in them.


572
00:29:58,57 --> 00:29:59,465
This one is convergent.


573
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,27



574
00:30:03,27 --> 00:30:04,52
And this series convergent.


575
00:30:04,52 --> 00:30:09,645
Now it turns out that
evaluating this is very easy.

576
00:30:11,07 --> 00:30:11,84
This is 1.


577
00:30:12,82 --> 00:30:14,015
It's easy to calculation.


578
00:30:15,31 --> 00:30:17,375
Evaluating this is very tricky.


579
00:30:19,5 --> 00:30:21,23
And Euler did it.


580
00:30:21,61 --> 00:30:24,255
And the answer with
pie squared over 6.

581
00:30:26,44 --> 00:30:28,07
That's amazing calculation.


582
00:30:29,05 --> 00:30:32,165
And it was done very early in
the history of mathematics.

583
00:30:33,57 --> 00:30:37,4
If you look at another
example-- so maybe example

584
00:30:37,4 --> 00:30:40,95
two here -if you look
at 1 over n cubed.

585
00:30:42,3 --> 00:30:46,38
n equals-- well you can't
start here at 0 by the way.

586
00:30:46,58 --> 00:30:48,675
I get to start where ever
I want in these series.

587
00:30:48,93 --> 00:30:49,92
Here I start with 0.


588
00:30:49,92 --> 00:30:50,95
Here I started with 1.


589
00:30:51,22 --> 00:30:55,34
And notice the reason why it
was a bad idea to start with 0

590
00:30:55,34 --> 00:30:57,28
was that 1 over 0 is undefined.


591
00:30:58,13 --> 00:31:00,43
Right so I'm just starting
where it's convenient for me.

592
00:31:00,43 --> 00:31:04,08
And since I'm interested mostly
in the tale behavior it doesn't

593
00:31:04,08 --> 00:31:05,815
matter to me so much
where I start.

594
00:31:06,15 --> 00:31:08,37
Although if I want an exact
answer I need to start

595
00:31:08,37 --> 00:31:09,71
exactly at n equals 1.


596
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:10,89
All right.


597
00:31:10,89 --> 00:31:16,765
This one is similar to
this integral here.

598
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:18,7
All right.


599
00:31:18,7 --> 00:31:20,07
Which is convergent again.


600
00:31:20,44 --> 00:31:22,03
So there's a number
that you get.

601
00:31:22,39 --> 00:31:26,84
And let's see what is it
something like 2 thirds or

602
00:31:26,84 --> 00:31:29,845
something like that for
this for this number.

603
00:31:30,19 --> 00:31:30,985
Or a third.


604
00:31:32,44 --> 00:31:33,11
What is it?


605
00:31:33,11 --> 00:31:33,4
No a half.


606
00:31:33,69 --> 00:31:34,52
I guess it's a half.


607
00:31:35 --> 00:31:35,82
This one is a half.


608
00:31:37,11 --> 00:31:39,7
You check that I'm not positive
but anyway just doing it

609
00:31:39,7 --> 00:31:41,69
in my head quickly it
seems to be a half.

610
00:31:42,15 --> 00:31:43,715
Anyway it's an easy
number to calculate.

611
00:31:44,1 --> 00:31:48,94
This one over here
stumped mathematicians

612
00:31:48,94 --> 00:31:50,53
basically for all time.


613
00:31:51,87 --> 00:31:55,035
It doesn't have any kind of
elementary form like this.

614
00:31:56,25 --> 00:31:58,855
And it was only very recently
proved to be rational.

615
00:31:59,91 --> 00:32:02,05
People couldn't even couldn't
even decide whether this was

616
00:32:02,05 --> 00:32:03,476
a rational number or not.


617
00:32:05,26 --> 00:32:07,83
But anyway that's been resolved
it is an irrational number

618
00:32:07,83 --> 00:32:08,866
which is what people suspected.


619
00:32:09,54 --> 00:32:10,375
Yeah question.


620
00:32:10,65 --> 00:32:14,36
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


621
00:32:14,36 --> 00:32:15,496
PROFESSOR: Yeah sorry.


622
00:32:16,35 --> 00:32:25,44
OK I violated a rule of
mathematics-- you said

623
00:32:25,44 --> 00:32:26,32
why is this similar?


624
00:32:26,72 --> 00:32:28,835
I thought that similar
was something else.

625
00:32:29,14 --> 00:32:30,38
And you're absolutely right.


626
00:32:30,38 --> 00:32:32,846
And I violated a rule
of mathematics.

627
00:32:33,52 --> 00:32:37,18
Which is that I uses
this symbol for two

628
00:32:37,18 --> 00:32:37,825
different things.


629
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:41,21



630
00:32:41,21 --> 00:32:42,82
I should have written
this symbol here.

631
00:32:42,82 --> 00:32:43,175
All right.


632
00:32:43,53 --> 00:32:44,935
I'll create a new symbol here.


633
00:32:45,26 --> 00:32:48,23
The question of whether this
converges or this converges.

634
00:32:48,92 --> 00:32:51,52
These are this the same
type of question.

635
00:32:51,92 --> 00:32:54,09
And we'll see why they're
the same question it

636
00:32:54,09 --> 00:32:54,73
in a few minutes.


637
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59,78
But in fact the wiggle I use
similar I used for the

638
00:32:59,78 --> 00:33:00,75
connection between functions.


639
00:33:02,36 --> 00:33:05,24
The things that are really
similar are that 1 over n

640
00:33:05,24 --> 00:33:09,456
resembles 1 over x squared.


641
00:33:10,23 --> 00:33:12,79
So I apologize I didn't--


642
00:33:12,79 --> 00:33:15,89
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]


643
00:33:15,89 --> 00:33:18,14
PROFESSOR: Oh you thought
that this was the

644
00:33:18,14 --> 00:33:19,29
definition of that.


645
00:33:19,29 --> 00:33:20,95
That's actually the
reason why these things

646
00:33:20,95 --> 00:33:21,99
correspond so closely.


647
00:33:21,99 --> 00:33:25,26
That is that the Riemann's
sum is close to this.

648
00:33:25,56 --> 00:33:26,753
But that doesn't
mean they're equal.

649
00:33:27,52 --> 00:33:30,55
The Riemann's sum only works
when the delta x goes to 0.

650
00:33:31,95 --> 00:33:33,87
The way that we're going to get
a connection between these two

651
00:33:33,87 --> 00:33:37,41
as, we will just a second,
is with a Riemann sum with.

652
00:33:38,49 --> 00:33:44,18
What we're going to use
is a Riemann's sum

653
00:33:44,18 --> 00:33:45,95
with delta x equals 1.


654
00:33:47,18 --> 00:33:49,825
All right and then that will
be the connection between.

655
00:33:50,24 --> 00:33:51,45
Right that's absolutely right.


656
00:33:53,48 --> 00:33:53,74
All right.


657
00:33:53,74 --> 00:33:57,02



658
00:33:57,02 --> 00:34:00,4
So in order to illustrate
exactly this idea that

659
00:34:00,4 --> 00:34:01,52
you've just come up with.


660
00:34:01,52 --> 00:34:03,11
And in fact that
we're going to use.

661
00:34:03,11 --> 00:34:05,82
We'll do the same thing but
we're going to do it on

662
00:34:05,82 --> 00:34:08
the example sum 1 over n.


663
00:34:08 --> 00:34:13,38



664
00:34:13,38 --> 00:34:20,17
So here's example 3 and it's
going to be sum 1 over n,

665
00:34:20,17 --> 00:34:21,369
n equals 1 to infinity.


666
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:24,09



667
00:34:24,09 --> 00:34:28,29
And what we're now going to
see is that it corresponds

668
00:34:28,29 --> 00:34:29,34
to this integral here.


669
00:34:29,34 --> 00:34:32,62



670
00:34:32,62 --> 00:34:35,695
And we're going to show
therefore that thing diverges.

671
00:34:37,87 --> 00:34:39,995
But we're going to
do more carefully.

672
00:34:40,3 --> 00:34:44,52
We're going to do this in some
detail so that you see what the

673
00:34:44,52 --> 00:34:47,084
correspondence is between
these quantities.

674
00:34:47,39 --> 00:34:50,03
And the same sort of
reasoning applies to

675
00:34:50,03 --> 00:34:51,275
these other examples.


676
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:55,82



677
00:34:55,82 --> 00:34:56,77
So here we go.


678
00:34:59,18 --> 00:35:05,34
I'm going to take the integral
and draw the picture

679
00:35:05,34 --> 00:35:06,745
of the Riemann's sum.


680
00:35:07,22 --> 00:35:10,84
So here's the level one
and here's the function

681
00:35:10,84 --> 00:35:12,39
y equals 1 over x.


682
00:35:13,84 --> 00:35:15,73
And I'm going to take
the Riemann's sum.

683
00:35:15,73 --> 00:35:21,98



684
00:35:21,98 --> 00:35:24,845
With delta x equals 1.


685
00:35:25,2 --> 00:35:27,07
And that's going to be
closely connected to

686
00:35:27,07 --> 00:35:29,57
the series that I have.


687
00:35:29,57 --> 00:35:32,16



688
00:35:32,16 --> 00:35:35,51
But now I have to decide
whether I want to lower

689
00:35:35,51 --> 00:35:37,82
Riemann's sum or an
upper Riemann's sum.

690
00:35:37,82 --> 00:35:40,18
And actually I'm going to check
both of them because both

691
00:35:40,18 --> 00:35:41,135
of them are illuminating.


692
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:44,62



693
00:35:44,62 --> 00:35:46,36
First will do the
upper Riemann's sum.

694
00:35:47 --> 00:35:48,7
Now that's this staircase here.


695
00:35:48,7 --> 00:35:51,78



696
00:35:51,78 --> 00:35:54,6
So we'll call this the
upper Riemann's sum.

697
00:35:54,6 --> 00:35:58,13



698
00:35:58,13 --> 00:35:59,71
And let's check what
it's levels are.

699
00:35:59,71 --> 00:36:00,813
This is not to scale.


700
00:36:01,56 --> 00:36:02,85
This level should be a half.


701
00:36:03,25 --> 00:36:05,61
So if this is 1 and this is 2
and that level was supposed to

702
00:36:05,61 --> 00:36:08,205
be a half then this next
level should be a third.

703
00:36:10,34 --> 00:36:12,83
That's how the Riemann's
sums are working out.

704
00:36:12,83 --> 00:36:17,04



705
00:36:17,04 --> 00:36:20,265
And now I have the
following phenomenon.

706
00:36:21,77 --> 00:36:23,34
Let's cut it off at the n.


707
00:36:24,64 --> 00:36:29,31
So that means that the integral
if from 1 to n d x over x.

708
00:36:30,76 --> 00:36:32,96
And the Riemann's sum
is something that's

709
00:36:32,96 --> 00:36:33,69
bigger than it.


710
00:36:33,69 --> 00:36:38,84
Because the areas are enclosing
the area of the curved region.

711
00:36:40,3 --> 00:36:44,72
And that's going to be the area
of the first box which is 1,

712
00:36:44,72 --> 00:36:50,826
plus the area of the second box
which is a half plus the

713
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:52,51
area of the third box
which is a third.

714
00:36:54,15 --> 00:36:59,31
All the way up the last one
but the last one starts

715
00:36:59,31 --> 00:37:00,425
today n minus 1.


716
00:37:00,84 --> 00:37:03,185
So it has 1 over n minus 1.


717
00:37:03,45 --> 00:37:05,78
There are not n boxes here.


718
00:37:05,78 --> 00:37:07,5
They're only n minus 1 boxes.


719
00:37:07,96 --> 00:37:11,13
Because the distance between
1 n is n minus one.

720
00:37:11,83 --> 00:37:13,555
Right so this is n
minus one terms.

721
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:17,33



722
00:37:17,33 --> 00:37:23,172
However if I use a
notation for partial sum.

723
00:37:25,14 --> 00:37:29,92
Which is 1 plus 1 over 2 plus
all the way up to n over n

724
00:37:29,92 --> 00:37:32,01
minus one plus 1 over n.


725
00:37:33,53 --> 00:37:35,48
In other words I go out to
the n one which is what

726
00:37:35,48 --> 00:37:36,875
I would ordinarily do.


727
00:37:37,37 --> 00:37:42,7
Then this sum that I have here
certainly is less than sn.

728
00:37:42,9 --> 00:37:45,68
Because there's one
more term there.

729
00:37:47,85 --> 00:37:51,07
And so here I have an
integral which is

730
00:37:51,07 --> 00:37:53,9
underneath this sum s n.


731
00:37:53,9 --> 00:38:01,7



732
00:38:01,7 --> 00:38:20,84
Now this is going to allow
us to prove conclusively

733
00:38:20,84 --> 00:38:21,68
that the sum diverges.


734
00:38:22,35 --> 00:38:23,34
Why is that?


735
00:38:23,34 --> 00:38:25,213
Because this term here
we can calculate.

736
00:38:26 --> 00:38:29,04
This is the log x
evaluated at 1 and n.

737
00:38:29,47 --> 00:38:33,77
Which is the same thing
as log n minus 0.

738
00:38:34,85 --> 00:38:38,26
All right the quantity log
n minus log 1 which is 0.

739
00:38:39,27 --> 00:38:45,458
And so what we have here is
that log n is less than s n.

740
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:51,455
All right and clearly this
goes to infinity right.

741
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:56,337
As n goes to infinity this
thing goes to infinity.

742
00:38:57,83 --> 00:38:58,435
So we're done.


743
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,33
All right we've
shown divergence.

744
00:39:00,33 --> 00:39:08,73



745
00:39:08,73 --> 00:39:16
The way I'm going to use the
lower Riemann's sum is to

746
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21,153
recognize that we've captured
the rate appropriately.

747
00:39:21,96 --> 00:39:24,52
That is not only do have a
lower bound like this but

748
00:39:24,52 --> 00:39:26,43
I have an upper bound
which is very similar.

749
00:39:27,86 --> 00:39:30,44
So if I use the upper--
remind oh sorry --the

750
00:39:30,44 --> 00:39:39,54
lower Riemann's sum again
with delta x equals 1.

751
00:39:39,54 --> 00:39:43,76



752
00:39:43,76 --> 00:39:55,53
Then I have that the integral
from 1 to n of d x over x is

753
00:39:55,53 --> 00:39:58,26
bigger than-- Well what are
the terms going to be if

754
00:39:58,26 --> 00:39:59,095
fit sit them underneath?


755
00:40:00,64 --> 00:40:03,21
If I fit them underneath I'm
missing the first term.

756
00:40:03,21 --> 00:40:05,6
That is the box is going
to be half height.

757
00:40:05,6 --> 00:40:07,97
It's going to be
this lower piece.

758
00:40:08,3 --> 00:40:10,155
So I'm missing this first term.


759
00:40:10,48 --> 00:40:17,87
So it'll be a half plus a third
plus it will keep on going.

760
00:40:18,15 --> 00:40:22,15
But now the last one instead
of being 1 over n minus 1.

761
00:40:22,15 --> 00:40:23,43
It's going to be 1 over n.


762
00:40:23,84 --> 00:40:26,105
This is again a total of
the n minus 1 terms.

763
00:40:27,05 --> 00:40:28,43
This is the lower
Riemann's sum.

764
00:40:28,43 --> 00:40:31,19



765
00:40:31,19 --> 00:40:41,25
And now we can recognize that
this is exactly equal to s n

766
00:40:41,25 --> 00:40:43,165
minus 1 minus the first term.


767
00:40:43,52 --> 00:40:46,33
So we missed the first term but
we got all the rest of them.

768
00:40:47,11 --> 00:40:49,7
So if I put this to the
other side remember

769
00:40:49,7 --> 00:40:50,8
this is the log n.


770
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:53,305
All right.


771
00:40:53,77 --> 00:40:55,73
If I put this to the other
side I have the other

772
00:40:55,73 --> 00:40:56,75
side of this bound.


773
00:40:57,13 --> 00:41:05,96
I have that f n is less than
if I reverse it log n plus 1.

774
00:41:07,01 --> 00:41:09,04
And so I've trapped it
on the other side.

775
00:41:09,04 --> 00:41:10,61
And here I have
the lower bound.

776
00:41:10,95 --> 00:41:12,87
So I'm going to combine
those together.

777
00:41:13,17 --> 00:41:17,54
So all hold I have this
correspondence here.

778
00:41:18,03 --> 00:41:24,52
It is the size of a log n is
trapped between the size of f n

779
00:41:24,52 --> 00:41:27,64
which is relatively hard to
calculate and understand

780
00:41:27,64 --> 00:41:32,57
exactly is trapped between
log n and log n plus 1.

781
00:41:34,26 --> 00:41:34,875
Yeah question.


782
00:41:35,16 --> 00:41:46,28
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]


783
00:41:46,28 --> 00:41:48,1
PROFESSOR: This step here
is the step that you're

784
00:41:48,1 --> 00:41:48,92
concerned about.


785
00:41:49,55 --> 00:41:54,58
So this step is a geometric
argument which is

786
00:41:54,58 --> 00:41:57,07
analogous to this step.


787
00:41:57,07 --> 00:42:00,865
All right it's the same
type of argument.

788
00:42:01,32 --> 00:42:05,28
And in this case it's that the
rectangle is on top and so the

789
00:42:05,28 --> 00:42:08,17
area represented on the right
hand side is less than the area

790
00:42:08,17 --> 00:42:09,53
represented on this side.


791
00:42:09,84 --> 00:42:12,13
And this is the same type
of thing except that the

792
00:42:12,13 --> 00:42:13,09
rectangle is underneath.


793
00:42:14,4 --> 00:42:18,02
So the sum of the areas of
the rectangle is less than

794
00:42:18,02 --> 00:42:19,19
the area under the curve.


795
00:42:19,19 --> 00:42:23,84



796
00:42:23,84 --> 00:42:24,24
All right.


797
00:42:24,24 --> 00:42:26,613
So I've now trapped
this quantity.

798
00:42:27,38 --> 00:42:34,44
And I'm now going to state
the sort of general results.

799
00:42:34,44 --> 00:42:38,42



800
00:42:38,42 --> 00:42:40,42
So here's what's known
as integral comparison.

801
00:42:42,23 --> 00:42:45,71
It's this double arrow
correspondence in the general

802
00:42:45,71 --> 00:42:54,58
case, for a very general case.


803
00:42:54,58 --> 00:42:57,13
There is actually even more
cases where it works.

804
00:42:57,13 --> 00:43:00,823
But this is a good
case and convenient.

805
00:43:01,51 --> 00:43:02,845
And this is called
integral comparison.

806
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:07,06



807
00:43:07,06 --> 00:43:11,72
And it comes with hypothesis
but it follows the same

808
00:43:11,72 --> 00:43:12,785
argument that I just gave.


809
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:35,29
If f of x is decreasing and
it's positive then the sum f n,

810
00:43:35,29 --> 00:43:39,615
n equals 1 to infinity minus
the integral from 1 to infinity

811
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:45,62
of f of x d x is less
than half of 1.

812
00:43:45,62 --> 00:43:50,06



813
00:43:50,06 --> 00:43:51,325
That's basically
what we showed.

814
00:43:51,59 --> 00:43:54,14
We showed that the difference
between s n and log

815
00:43:54,14 --> 00:43:55,93
n was at most 1.


816
00:43:55,93 --> 00:43:59,66



817
00:43:59,66 --> 00:44:00,06
All right.


818
00:44:00,06 --> 00:44:03,79



819
00:44:03,79 --> 00:44:23,91
And the sum and the integral
converge or diverge together.

820
00:44:25,38 --> 00:44:27,75
That is they either both
converge or both diverge.

821
00:44:27,75 --> 00:44:30,57
This is the type of test that
we like because then we can

822
00:44:30,57 --> 00:44:33,86
just convert the question of
convergence over here to this

823
00:44:33,86 --> 00:44:35,8
question of convergence
over on the other side.

824
00:44:37,77 --> 00:44:41,69
Now I remind you that
it's incredibly hard to

825
00:44:41,69 --> 00:44:42,91
calculate these numbers.


826
00:44:44,87 --> 00:44:46,955
Whereas these numbers are
easier to calculate.

827
00:44:47,22 --> 00:44:50,39
Our goal is to reduce
things to simpler things.

828
00:44:50,39 --> 00:44:53,96
In this case sums, infinite
sums are much harder

829
00:44:53,96 --> 00:44:54,72
than infinite integrals.


830
00:44:54,72 --> 00:45:00,08



831
00:45:00,08 --> 00:45:01,75
All right so that the
integral comparison.

832
00:45:03,15 --> 00:45:12,34
And now I have one last
bit on comparisons that I

833
00:45:12,34 --> 00:45:13,84
need to tell you about.


834
00:45:13,84 --> 00:45:16,03
And this is very much like
what we did with integrals.

835
00:45:16,31 --> 00:45:18,24
Which is so called
limit comparison.

836
00:45:18,24 --> 00:45:29,2



837
00:45:29,2 --> 00:45:36,73
The limits comparison says
the following if f of n

838
00:45:36,73 --> 00:45:38,27
is similar to g of n.


839
00:45:38,27 --> 00:45:45,67
You will recall that means f
of n over g of n tends to

840
00:45:45,67 --> 00:45:47,85
1 as n goes to infinity.


841
00:45:47,85 --> 00:45:51,76



842
00:45:51,76 --> 00:45:54,66
And we're in the positive case.


843
00:45:55 --> 00:45:57,535
So let's just say
g n is positive.

844
00:45:57,535 --> 00:46:03,92



845
00:46:03,92 --> 00:46:18,09
Then sum f n sum g n same
this as above, either both

846
00:46:18,09 --> 00:46:21,884
converge or both diverge.


847
00:46:21,884 --> 00:46:27,488



848
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:28,365
All right.


849
00:46:28,77 --> 00:46:31,34
This is just saying that if
they behave the same way in the

850
00:46:31,34 --> 00:46:36,63
tail, which is all we really
care about, then they have

851
00:46:36,63 --> 00:46:40,82
similar behavior, similar
convergence properties.

852
00:46:40,82 --> 00:46:44,62



853
00:46:44,62 --> 00:46:45,69
And let me give you
a couple examples.

854
00:46:45,69 --> 00:46:50,37



855
00:46:50,37 --> 00:46:55,36
So here's one example if
you take the sum 1 over n

856
00:46:55,36 --> 00:46:57,08
squared plus 1 square root.


857
00:46:57,08 --> 00:47:01,89



858
00:47:01,89 --> 00:47:05,065
This is going to be replaced
by something simpler.

859
00:47:05,35 --> 00:47:06,895
Which is the main term here.


860
00:47:07,24 --> 00:47:12,58
Which is 1 over square root of
n squared which we recognize as

861
00:47:12,58 --> 00:47:15,1
sum 1 over n which diverges.


862
00:47:15,1 --> 00:47:17,92



863
00:47:17,92 --> 00:47:20,44
So this guy is one
of the red guys.

864
00:47:20,44 --> 00:47:24,3



865
00:47:24,3 --> 00:47:30,33
On the red team now we
have another example.

866
00:47:30,33 --> 00:47:33,37



867
00:47:33,37 --> 00:47:40,19
Which is let's say the square
root of n to the fifth

868
00:47:40,19 --> 00:47:42,28
minus n squared.


869
00:47:43,08 --> 00:47:45,71
Now if you have something
where it's negative in the

870
00:47:45,71 --> 00:47:48,4
denominator you kind of
do have to watch out that

871
00:47:48,4 --> 00:47:49,54
denominator makes sense.


872
00:47:49,54 --> 00:47:50,24
It isn't 0.


873
00:47:50,57 --> 00:47:53,42
So we're going to be careful
and start this at n equals 2.

874
00:47:53,42 --> 00:47:59,34



875
00:47:59,34 --> 00:48:01,72
I don't like 1 over 0 as
a term in my series.

876
00:48:01,72 --> 00:48:04,44
So I'm just going to be a
little careful about how-- as I

877
00:48:04,44 --> 00:48:05,71
said I was kind of lazy here.


878
00:48:05,71 --> 00:48:08,01
I could have started this
one at 0 for instance.

879
00:48:09,93 --> 00:48:10,81
All right.


880
00:48:10,81 --> 00:48:13,83
So here's the picture.


881
00:48:14,11 --> 00:48:18,44
Now this I just replace by it's
main term which is 1 over n

882
00:48:18,44 --> 00:48:19,64
to the fifth square root.


883
00:48:20,34 --> 00:48:25,975
Which is sum 1 over n to the
five halves which converges.

884
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:28,705



885
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,52
All right.


886
00:48:29,52 --> 00:48:30,8
The power is bigger than 1.


887
00:48:30,8 --> 00:48:33,96
1 is the divider for these
things and it just misses.

888
00:48:33,96 --> 00:48:36,964
This one converges.


889
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:45,62
All right so these are the
typical ways in which these

890
00:48:45,62 --> 00:48:47,05
convergence processes are used.


891
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:47,87
All right.


892
00:48:47,87 --> 00:48:49,56
So I have one more
thing for you.

893
00:48:49,93 --> 00:48:52,295
Which is an advertisement
for next time.

894
00:48:52,6 --> 00:48:54,696
And I have this demo
here which I will grab.

895
00:48:56,36 --> 00:48:57,85
But you will see
this next time.

896
00:48:58,3 --> 00:49:01,5
So here's a question for you to
think about overnight but don't

897
00:49:01,5 --> 00:49:04,24
ask friends you have to
think about yourself.

898
00:49:04,24 --> 00:49:05,146
So here's the problem.


899
00:49:05,492 --> 00:49:08,18
Here are some blocks
which I acquired when

900
00:49:08,18 --> 00:49:09,39
my kids left home.


901
00:49:09,39 --> 00:49:12,19



902
00:49:12,19 --> 00:49:19,395
Anyway yeah that'll happen to
you too in about four years.

903
00:49:20,55 --> 00:49:25,775
So now here you are
these are blocks.

904
00:49:26,1 --> 00:49:27,93
So now here's the question
that we're going to

905
00:49:27,93 --> 00:49:29,13
deal with next time.


906
00:49:29,86 --> 00:49:32,03
I'm going to build it, maybe
I'll put it over here

907
00:49:32,03 --> 00:49:33,81
because I want to have some
room to head this way.

908
00:49:34,89 --> 00:49:41,32
I want to stack them up
so that-- oh didn't work

909
00:49:41,32 --> 00:49:44,26
--going to stack them up
in the following way.

910
00:49:44,43 --> 00:49:48,53
I want to do it so that the
top one is completely to the

911
00:49:48,53 --> 00:49:50,23
right of the bottom one.


912
00:49:51,54 --> 00:49:53,5
That's the question
can I do that?

913
00:49:55,84 --> 00:49:57,06
Can I build this up?


914
00:49:57,87 --> 00:49:59,52
So what's let's see here.


915
00:50:01,98 --> 00:50:04,69
I just seem to be missing-- but
anyway what I'm going to do is

916
00:50:04,69 --> 00:50:07,12
I'm going to try to build this
and we're going to see how far

917
00:50:07,12 --> 00:50:10,93
we can get with this next time.


918
00:50:10,93 --> 00:50:11,678
