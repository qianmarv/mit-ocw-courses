8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,110
PROFESSOR: Today, I'm going to
continue the idea of setting up

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,790
integrals.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:39,090
And what we'll deal with
is volumes by slices.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:47,240
By slicing.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,010
And it's lucky that
this is after lunch.

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,960
Maybe it's after
breakfast for some of you,

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,050
because there's the typical way
of introducing this subject is

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,380
with a food analogy.

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,790
There's a lot of ways
of slicing up food.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,420
And we'll give a few more
examples than just this one.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,560
But, suppose you
have, well, suppose

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,870
you have a loaf of bread here.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:21,077
So here's our loaf
of bread, and I

21
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:23,160
hope that looks a little
bit like a loaf of bread.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,670
It's supposed to be
sitting on the kitchen

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,920
counter ready to be eaten.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,260
And in order to figure out
how much bread there is there,

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,290
one way of doing it is
to cut it into slices.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,980
Now, you probably know
that bread is often

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,020
sliced like this.

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,080
There are even
machines to do it.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,450
And with this setup
here, I'll draw the slice

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,830
with a little bit of a
more colorful decoration.

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,980
So here's our red
slice of bread.

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,150
It's coming around like this.

33
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,280
And it comes back down behind.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
So here's our bread slice.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:21,930
And what I'd like to
figure out is its volume.

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,850
So first of all, there's
the thickness of the bread.

37
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,950
Which is this
dimension, the thickness

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:35,490
is this dimension dx here.

39
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,730
And the only other dimension
that I'm going to give,

40
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,900
because this is a very
qualitative analysis for now,

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,610
is what I'll call the area.

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,660
And that's the area on
the face of the slice.

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,150
And so the area of
one slice, which

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,240
I'll denote by delta V,
that's a chunk of volume,

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,430
is approximately the area
times the change in x.

46
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:13,630
And in the limit, that's going
to be something like this.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,029
And maybe the areas
of the slices vary.

48
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,320
There might be a little hole
in the middle of the bread

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,819
somewhere.

50
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,010
Maybe it gets a little
small on one side.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,170
So it might change as x changes.

52
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,760
And the whole volume
you get by adding up.

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,580
So if you like,
this is one slice.

54
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,830
And this is the sum.

55
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,810
And you should think of it
in a sort of intuitive way

56
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,070
as being analogous to the
Riemann sum, where you would

57
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,390
take each slice individually.

58
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,300
And that would look like this.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:01,720
Alright, so that's just a
superficial and intuitive way

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,830
of looking at it.

61
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,810
Now, we're only going
to talk about one

62
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,325
kind of systematic slice.

63
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:07,960
It's already on
your problem set,

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,810
you had an example of
a slice of some region.

65
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,990
But we're only going to talk
systematically about something

66
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:32,330
called solids of revolution.

67
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,430
The idea here is this.

68
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,930
Suppose you have some
shape, some graph,

69
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,700
which maybe looks like this.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,220
And now I'm going to revolve it.

71
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,880
This is the x-axis and
this is the y-axis.

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:58,470
In this case, I'm going to
revolve it around the x-axis.

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,760
If you do that, then
the shape that you get

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,310
is maybe like this.

75
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,930
If I can draw it a little bit.

76
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,600
It's maybe a football.

77
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,015
So that's the shape that you get
if you take this piece of disk

78
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,540
and you revolve it around.

79
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,500
If you had made this
copy underneath,

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,360
it still would have
been the same region.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,950
So we only pay attention to
what's above the axis here.

82
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,600
So that's the basic idea.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,530
Now, I'm going to apply
the method of slices

84
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,940
to figure out the
volume of such regions

85
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,510
and give you a general formula.

86
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,240
And then apply it
in a specific case.

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,254
I want to take one little
slice of this football,

88
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:45,920
maybe a football
wouldn't work too well,

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,380
maybe we should go back
to a loaf of bread.

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,180
Anyway, the key point
is that you never really

91
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,270
have to draw a 3-D picture.

92
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,820
And 3-D pictures are awful.

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,600
They're very hard to deal with.

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,460
And it's hard to
visualize with them.

95
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,010
And one of the reasons why
we're dealing with solids

96
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,020
of revolution is that we don't
have as many visualization

97
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,730
problems.

98
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,170
So we're only going
to deal with this.

99
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,240
And then you have
to imagine from

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,902
the two-dimensional
cross-section what

101
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,610
the three-dimensional
picture looks like.

102
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,372
So we'll do a little
bit of an exercise

103
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:22,830
with the
three-dimensional picture.

104
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,990
But ultimately, you
should be used to,

105
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,770
getting used to, drawing
2-D diagrams always.

106
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,710
To depict the
three-dimensional situation.

107
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,310
Since it's much harder to draw.

108
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,540
The first step is to consider
what this slice is over here.

109
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,400
And again it's going
to have width dx.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,630
And we're going to consider
what it looks like over

111
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,560
on the 3-D picture.

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,980
So it starts out being
more or less like this.

113
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,210
But then we're going
to sweep it around.

114
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,280
We're revolving
around the x-axis,

115
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,370
so it's spinning
around this way.

116
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,210
And if you take
this and think of it

117
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,130
as being on a hinge, which
is down on the x-axis,

118
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,170
it's going to swing down and
swoop around and come back.

119
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,750
Swing around.

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,140
And that traces out
something over here.

121
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,900
Which I'm going
to draw this way.

122
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:22,960
It traces out a disk.

123
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,050
So it's hard for me to draw, and
I'm not going to try too hard.

124
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,240
Maybe I drew it more like a
wheel, looking like a wheel.

125
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,850
But anyway, it's this
little flat disk here.

126
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,110
And so the method
that I'm describing

127
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,050
for figuring out the volume
is called the method of disks.

128
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:56,910
This is going to be
our first method.

129
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,630
Now I'm going to
apply the reasoning

130
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,130
that I have up on the
previous blackboard here.

131
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,180
Namely, I need to get
the volume of this chunk.

132
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,850
And the way I'm going to
get the volume of this chunk

133
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,225
is by figuring out its
thickness and its area,

134
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,880
its cross-sectional area.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,490
And that's not too
difficult to do.

136
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,810
If this height, so this height
is what we usually call y.

137
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,140
And y is usually a function
of x, it's varying.

138
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,030
And this particular
distance is y.

139
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,500
Then the area of the face
is easy to calculate.

140
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,100
Because it's a circle, or a disk
if you like, with this radius.

141
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,540
So its area is pi y^2.

142
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,900
So that's, if you like,
one of the dimensions.

143
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,190
And then the thickness is dx.

144
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,360
So the incremental
volume is this.

145
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,140
So this is the method of disks.

146
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,480
And this is the integrand.

147
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,410
Now, there's one peculiar
thing about this formula.

148
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,065
And there are more peculiar
things about this formula.

149
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,690
But there's one
peculiar thing that you

150
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,130
should notice immediately.

151
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,840
Which is that I'm integrating
with respect to x.

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,260
And I haven't yet
told you what y is.

153
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,280
Well, that will depend on
what function y = f(x) I use.

154
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,222
So we have to plug
that in eventually.

155
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,180
If we're actually going
to calculate something,

156
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,700
we're going to have
to figure that out.

157
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,070
There's another
very important point

158
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,340
which is that in order to get
a definite integral, something

159
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,560
I haven't mentioned,
we're going to have

160
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,340
to figure out where
we're starting

161
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,050
and we're ending the picture.

162
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:52,250
Which is something we dealt
with last time in 2-D pictures.

163
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,400
So let's deal with an example.

164
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:05,220
And we'll switch over from
a football to a soccer ball.

165
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm going to take a circle,
and we'll say it has radius a.

166
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,750
So this is 0 and this is a.

167
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,260
And I'm putting it in this
particular spot for a reason.

168
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,820
You can do this in
lots of different ways,

169
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,990
but I'm picking this one
to make a certain exercise

170
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,970
on your homework easier for you.

171
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,330
Because I'm doing half
of it for you right now.

172
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,340
Appreciate it, yeah.

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,180
I'm sure especially
today it's appreciated.

174
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,330
So again, the formula
has to do with keeping

175
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,450
track of these slices here.

176
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,830
And we're sweeping
things around.

177
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,940
So the full region that
we're talking about

178
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:57,300
is the volume of the
ball of radius a.

179
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,900
That's what our goal
is, to figure out

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,870
what the volume of the
ball of radius a is.

181
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,670
Alright, again as I say,
the thing sweeps around.

182
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,800
Coming out of the blackboard,
spinning around on this x-axis.

183
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,480
So the setup is the following.

184
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,130
It's always the same.

185
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,210
Here's our formula.

186
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,240
And we need to figure out what's
going on with that formula.

187
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,830
And so we need to solve
for y as a function of x.

188
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,180
And in order to do that,
what we're going to do

189
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,890
is just write down the
equation for the circle.

190
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,800
This is the circle.

191
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,180
It's centered at (a, 0),
so that's its formula.

192
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,002
And now there's one
nice thing, which

193
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,460
is that we really didn't need
it to find the formula for y,

194
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,140
we only needed to find
the formula for y squared.

195
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,240
So let's just solve for y^2
and we won't have to solve

196
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,820
a quadratic or anything.

197
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,260
Take a square root, that's nice.

198
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,580
This is a^2 - (x^2 - 2ax + a^2).

199
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,170
The a^2's cancel.

200
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,720
These two terms cancel.

201
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:30,330
And so the formula
here is 2ax - x^2.

202
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,670
Alright now, that is what's
known as the integrand.

203
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,890
Well, except for this
factor of pi here.

204
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,900
And so the answer for the volume
is going to be the integral

205
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:51,050
of pi times this
integrand, (2ax - x^2) dx.

206
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,450
And that's just the
same thing as this.

207
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,536
But now there's also
the issue of the limits.

208
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:59,160
Which is a completely
separate problem,

209
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,720
which we also have to solve.

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,650
The range of x is, from
this leftmost point

211
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,130
to the rightmost point.

212
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,970
So x varies, starts at 0,
and it goes all the way up

213
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,310
to what, what's
the top value here.

214
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,340
2a.

215
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,290
And so now I have a
completely specified integral.

216
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,960
Again, and this was
the theme last time,

217
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,540
the whole goal is
to get ourselves

218
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,390
to a complete
formula for something

219
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,021
with an integrand and limits.

220
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,520
And then we'll be
able to calculate.

221
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,480
Now, we have clear sailing
to the end of the problem.

222
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,110
So let's just finish it off.

223
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,910
We have the volume is, if I
take the antiderivative of that,

224
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:53,850
that's pi ax^2, whose derivative
is 2ax, minus x^3 / 3.

225
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,250
That's the thing whose
derivative is -x^2.

226
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,290
Evaluated at 0 and 2a.

227
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,120
And that is equal to
pi times, let's see.

228
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,930
2^2 = 4.

229
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:19,130
So this is 4a^3 -
8a^3 / 3, right?

230
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:28,000
And so all told, that is,
let's see, (12/3 - 8/3) pi a^3.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,670
Which is maybe a familiar
formula, 4/3 pi a^3.

232
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,540
So it worked, we got it right.

233
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:48,060
Let me just point out a
couple of other things

234
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,020
about this formula.

235
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,740
The first one is that
from this point of view,

236
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,910
we've actually accomplished
more then just finding

237
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,490
the volume of the ball.

238
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,270
We've also found the
volume of a bunch

239
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,520
of intermediate regions,
which I can draw schematically

240
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,690
this way.

241
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,780
If I chop this thing, and
this portion is x here,

242
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,160
then the antiderivative
here, this region here,

243
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,970
which maybe I'll fill
in with this region

244
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,970
here, which I'm
going to call V(x),

245
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,500
is the volume of the
portion of the sphere.

246
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:53,160
Volume of portion of
width x of the ball.

247
00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:02,010
And, well, the formula for it is
that it's the volume equals pi

248
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,530
(ax ^2 - x^3 / 3).

249
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,654
That's it.

250
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,320
So we've got something
which is actually

251
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
a lot more information.

252
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,140
For instance, if
you plug in x = a,

253
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,500
not surprisingly, and
this is a good idea

254
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,940
to do because it checks
that we've actually

255
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,020
got a correct formula here.

256
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,480
So if you like you can
call this a double-check.

257
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:36,220
If you check V(a), this should
be the volume of a half-ball.

258
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,250
That's halfway.

259
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,660
If I go over here and
I only go up to a,

260
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,640
that's exactly half of the ball.

261
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,400
That had better be
half, so let's just see.

262
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:53,830
V(a) in this case is pi, and
then I have (a^3 - a^3 / 3).

263
00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:00,330
And that turns out to be pi
times a total of 2/3 a^3,

264
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:07,540
which is indeed half.

265
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,490
Now, on your problem set, what
you're going to want to look at

266
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,870
is this full formula here.

267
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,420
Of this chunk.

268
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,140
And what it's going to be good
for is a real-life problem.

269
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,510
That is, a problem
that really came up

270
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,930
over the summer, and this fall,
at a couple of universities

271
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,050
near here, where
people were trying

272
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,610
to figure out a phenomenon
which is well-known.

273
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:56,680
Namely, if you have a bunch
of particles in a fluid,

274
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,310
and maybe the size of
these things is 1 micron.

275
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,260
That is, the radius is 1 micron.

276
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,200
And then you have a bunch
of other little particles,

277
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,330
which are a lot smaller.

278
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,750
Maybe 10 nanometers.

279
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:23,470
Then what happens is that the
particles, the big particles,

280
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,030
like to hug each other.

281
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,120
They like to clump
together, they're very nice.

282
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,990
Friendly characters.

283
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,250
So what's the
explanation for this?

284
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,340
The explanation is
that actually they

285
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,842
are not quite as friendly
as they might seem.

286
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,800
What's really happening
is that the little guys

287
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,240
are shoving them around.

288
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,380
And pushing them together.

289
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,700
And they have sharp
elbows, the little ones

290
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,830
and they're pushing them.

291
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,480
Don't like them to be around and
they're pushing them together.

292
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,910
But there's actually
another possibility.

293
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,550
Which is that they
also will stick

294
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,180
to the sides of the container.

295
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,250
So there are two things
that actually happen here.

296
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,790
And if you want to get
a quantitative handle

297
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,340
on how much of this
happens, it has

298
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,500
to do with how much space
these things take up.

299
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,390
And so the issue is
some kind of overlap

300
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,000
between a band around
one sphere and a band

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,400
around the other sphere.

302
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,780
And this overlap region is
what you have to calculate.

303
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,600
You have to calculate
what's in here.

304
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,380
And you can do that
using this formula here.

305
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,300
It's not even difficult. So
this is, if you cut it in half,

306
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,290
turns out to be
two of these guys.

307
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,630
And then you're on your way
to figuring out this problem.

308
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,770
And the question is,
which do they prefer.

309
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,300
Do they prefer to
touch each other,

310
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,250
or do they prefer
to touch the wall.

311
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,050
Do they all cluster to the wall.

312
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,030
So you can actually see this
in solutions, what they do.

313
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,020
And the question
is, to what extent

314
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,580
do they prefer one
configuration to the other.

315
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,600
So that's a real, live
problem, which really comes up.

316
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,500
Came up just this year.

317
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,420
And frequently comes up.

318
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:23,640
Which is solved by
our first calculation.

319
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,350
So now I have, I
called this Method 1.

320
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,970
For solids of revolution, which
is called the method of disks.

321
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:38,670
And now I need to tell you
about the other standard method.

322
00:20:38,670 --> 00:21:07,850
Which is called the
method of shells.

323
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,350
So this is our second method.

324
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm going to illustrate this one
with a holiday-themed example

325
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
here.

326
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,310
This is supposed to be
a witches' cauldron.

327
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,280
Whoops, witch, witches, well.

328
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,970
Maybe more than one witch
will have this cauldron here.

329
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,560
So here's this shape.

330
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:44,500
And we're going to figure out
how much liquid is in here.

331
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm going to plot this.

332
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,210
Maybe I'll put this down
just a bit lower here.

333
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,750
And I'm going to
make it a parabola.

334
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,510
This is y = x^2.

335
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:08,940
And I'm going to make
the top height be y = a.

336
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,260
So here's my situation.

337
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,750
And I want to figure out
how much liquid is in here.

338
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,050
Now, the reason why I presented
the problem in this form,

339
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,780
of course, is really to get
you used to these things.

340
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,490
And the first new thing that
I want you to get used to

341
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,160
is the idea that now we can also
revolve around the y-axis, not

342
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,580
just the x-axis.

343
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:40,550
So this one is going to be
revolved around the y-axis.

344
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,550
And that's what happens.

345
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,790
If you spin the
parabola around, you

346
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:54,030
get this kind of shape, this
kind of solid shape here.

347
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:59,280
Now, I'm going to
use the same kind

348
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,530
of slicing that I did before.

349
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,370
But it's going to look
totally different.

350
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,180
Namely, I'll draw
it in red again.

351
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,820
I'm going to take a
little slice over here.

352
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,580
And now I want to imagine
what happens if it gets

353
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:23,060
revolved around the y-axis.

354
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,699
This time it's not a disk.

355
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,740
Actually, if I revolve
this around the other way,

356
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,140
it would have had a hole in it.

357
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,410
Which is also possible to do.

358
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,050
That's practically the same
as the method of disks.

359
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,387
You'll maybe discuss
that in recitation.

360
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,470
Anyway, we're going to
revolve it around this way.

361
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,760
So again, I need
to sweep it around,

362
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,080
swing it around like this.

363
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,590
And I'll draw the shape.

364
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,180
It's going to sweep
around in a circle

365
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,300
and maybe it'll have a little
bit of thickness to it.

366
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:06,620
And this is the thing
that people call a shell.

367
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,360
This is the so-called
shell of the method.

368
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,900
I would maybe call
it a cylinder,

369
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,690
and another way of
thinking about it

370
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:22,350
is that you can maybe
wrap up a piece of paper.

371
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,310
Like this.

372
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,440
There it is, there's a
cylinder you can see.

373
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Very thin, right?

374
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,990
Very thin.

375
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,590
Now, the reason why I
used the piece of paper

376
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,870
as an example of
this is that I'm

377
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,220
going to have to figure out
the volume of this thing.

378
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:56,110
Its thickness, as
usual, is equal to dx.

379
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,710
Its height is what?

380
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,570
Well, actually I have to
use the diagram to see that.

381
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:15,340
The top value is a, and the
bottom value is what we call y.

382
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,210
So the height is equal
to, I'm sorry, a - y.

383
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,127
Now, again this is an
incredibly risky thing here.

384
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:26,960
And I've done this
before I pointed this out

385
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,340
on the very first
day of lecture.

386
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,040
The letter y represents a
lot of different things.

387
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,460
And in disguise, when I
call this y, I mean y = x^2.

388
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,200
In other words, the
interesting curve.

389
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,080
I don't mean y = a,
which is the other part.

390
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:55,080
In general, you might think of
it as being equal to y_(top) -

391
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,780
y_(bottom).

392
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,140
So there are, of course,
two y's involved.

393
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,390
In disguise.

394
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,450
But we have a
shorthand, and the sort

395
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,290
of uninteresting
one we call by its--

396
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,340
we just evaluate immediately,
and the interesting one

397
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,330
we leave as the symbol y.

398
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,030
Now, the last bit that
I have to do, I claim,

399
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,330
in order to figure this
out, is the circumference.

400
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,130
And the reason for that is
that if I think of this thing

401
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,260
as like this tube,
or piece of paper

402
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,500
here, in order to figure out
how much stuff there is here,

403
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,160
all I have to do is unfold it.

404
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,629
Its size, the whole
quantity of paper

405
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:44,670
here is the same whether
it's rolled up like this

406
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,090
or whether it's stretched out.

407
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:56,110
So if I unwrap it,
it looks like what?

408
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,790
Well, it looks like
kind of a slab?

409
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:06,550
Right, it looks like
just a slab like this.

410
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,860
And again, the thickness is dx.

411
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,650
The height is a - y.

412
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,990
And now we can see
that the length here

413
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,100
is all the way around.

414
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,710
It's the circumference.

415
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,100
So this is going to be the
circumference when I unwrap it.

416
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,520
And in order to figure
out the circumference,

417
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,510
I need to figure out the radius.

418
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:34,800
So the radius is, on this
diagram, is right over there.

419
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,160
This is the radius.

420
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,430
And that distance is x.

421
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,850
So this length here is x.

422
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:56,440
And so this
circumference is 2 pi x.

423
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,520
And this height is
still ay. a - y, sorry.

424
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:13,610
And the thickness is still dx.

425
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,550
So in total, we're just going to
multiply these numbers together

426
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:27,110
to get the total volume.

427
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,260
We have, in other words,
dV is equal to the product

428
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:37,040
of the (2 pi x) dimension
dimension, the (8 - y)

429
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,150
dimension, and the dx dimension.

430
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,790
Incidentally,
dimensional analysis

431
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,700
is very useful and
important in these problems.

432
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,167
You can see that there
are three lengths being

433
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,000
multiplied together.

434
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,140
So we'll get a volume in end.

435
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,840
Something cubic.

436
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,839
And we will be coming
back to that, because it's

437
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,690
a quite subtle issue sometimes.

438
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,720
So here's the formula, and
let's simplify it a little bit.

439
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,690
We have 2 pi x times, remember,
first I have to substitute,

440
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,450
otherwise I'm never going
to be able to integrate.

441
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:22,460
And then I rewrite that as 2
pi (ax - x^2, whoops, x^3) dx.

442
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,470
Better not get that wrong.

443
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,280
And now the last little
bit here, that I had better

444
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,570
be careful about in
order to figure out

445
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:37,900
what the total volume
is, is the limits.

446
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,020
So the volume is going to be the
integral of this quantity 2 pi

447
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,600
(ax - x^3) dx.

448
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:58,660
And now I have to pay attention
to what the limits are.

449
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,130
Now, here you have
to be careful.

450
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,770
x is possibly the-- You
have to always go back

451
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,200
to the 2-D diagram.

452
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,810
I went to it immediately,
but that's the whole point.

453
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,990
Is that everything gets read
off from this diagram here.

454
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,380
When you take this guy
and you sweep it around,

455
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,330
you take care of everything
that's to the left.

456
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,830
So we only have to count
what's to the right.

457
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,580
We don't have to count
anything over here.

458
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,740
Because it's taken care
of when we sweep around.

459
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,490
So the starting place
is going to be x = 0.

460
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,810
That's where we start.

461
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:41,070
And where we end is the
farthest, rightmost spot for x.

462
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,680
Which is down here.

463
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,930
You've got to watch out
about where that is.

464
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,300
In the y variable,
it's up at y = a.

465
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,080
But in the x variable, we
can see that it's what?

466
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,230
It's the square root of a.

467
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,700
So these limits,
this is where you're

468
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,767
going to focus all your
attention on the integrand

469
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:02,850
and getting it just right.

470
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,790
And then you're going
to lose your steam

471
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,830
and not pay attention
to the limits.

472
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,619
They're equally important.

473
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,035
You've no hope of getting the
right answer without getting

474
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:14,060
the limits right.

475
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,020
So this is the integral
from 0 to square root of a.

476
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:26,463
Again, that's just because y =
a and y = x^2 implies x = square

477
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,950
root a.

478
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,300
That's that upper limit there.

479
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,900
And now, we're ready
to carry out this,

480
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,490
to evaluate this integral.

481
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,650
So we get 2-- sorry, we get
2 pi ax, that's pi ax^2.

482
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,060
Maybe I'll leave
the 2's in there.

483
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,210
2 pi ax^2 is the antiderivative
of this ax^2 / 2,

484
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:59,810
and then here x^4 / 4, evaluated
at 0 and square root of a.

485
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:05,560
And finally, let's
see, what is that.

486
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:14,410
That's 2 pi (a^2 / 2 - a^2 / 4).

487
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:19,900
Which is a total of 1/4,
right, 2 pi a^2 / 4.

488
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,990
Which is pi/2 a^2.

489
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,920
Yes, question.

490
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:40,322
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

491
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:41,030
PROFESSOR: Right.

492
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,570
So the question is,
why did I integrate

493
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,890
only from the
middle to this end,

494
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,560
instead of all the
way from over here,

495
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,150
minus square root of a, all
the way to the plus end.

496
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,220
And the reason is that
you have to look at what's

497
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,470
happening with the rotation.

498
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,820
This red guy, when
I swept it around,

499
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,350
I counted the stuff to
the right and the left.

500
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,680
So in other words, if I just
rotate the right half of this,

501
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,210
I'm covering the left half.

502
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,970
So if I counted the stuff
from minus square root of a,

503
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,190
I would be doing it twice.

504
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,910
I would be doubling what I need.

505
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,040
So it's too much.

506
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,450
Another way of saying
it is if I wanted

507
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,810
to take the whole
region, if I rotate it

508
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,380
around only 180
degrees, only pi, that

509
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,610
would fill up the whole
region, if I did both halves.

510
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,000
And then instead of a
circumference, instead of a 2

511
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,850
pi x, I could use a pi x.

512
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,180
But then I would have
double what I had.

513
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,980
So there are two ways
of looking at it.

514
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,140
The same goes, actually,
for the football case.

515
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,930
When I have that football, I
didn't count the bottom part.

516
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,940
Because when I swung
it around the x-axis,

517
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,870
the top part sufficed and I
could ignore the bottom half.

518
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,140
Yeah, another question.

519
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

520
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,260
PROFESSOR: Ooh, good question.

521
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,290
The question is, when
do you know, how do you

522
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,910
know when to take the rectangle
to be vertical or horizontal.

523
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,850
So far we've only done
vertical rectangles.

524
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,350
And I'm going to do a
horizontal example in a second.

525
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:23,560
And the answer to the question
of when you do it is this.

526
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,300
You can always set
it up both ways.

527
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,560
One way may be a
difficult calculation

528
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,130
and one way may be an
easier calculation.

529
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,079
Yesterday, we did it -
or, sorry, the last time.

530
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,370
Yeah, I guess it was yesterday.

531
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,890
We did it with-- and the
horizontal and the vertical

532
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,954
were quite different
in character.

533
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,870
One of them was really
a mess, and one of them

534
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,130
was a little easier.

535
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,620
So very often, one will
be easier than the other.

536
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,790
Every once in a while,
one of them is impossible

537
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,640
and the other one is possible.

538
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,210
In other words, the difference
in difficulty can be extreme.

539
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,670
So you don't know
that in advance.

540
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,870
Yeah, another question.

541
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,990
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

542
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,790
PROFESSOR: The
question is, did we

543
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,580
just find the volume
when you rotate

544
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,510
this green region around.

545
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:17,290
Or, did we find the volume when
we rotate this whole region.

546
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,711
In other words, just the right
half or the right and the

547
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:20,210
left half.

548
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,870
The answer is both.

549
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,280
The region that you
get is the same.

550
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,114
You always get this
cauldron, whether you

551
00:35:27,114 --> 00:35:29,030
take this right half
when you rotate it around

552
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,974
or you take both and
you rotate it around.

553
00:35:32,974 --> 00:35:35,140
So the answer to both of
those questions is the same

554
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,730
and it's this.

555
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,170
Yes.

556
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:43,207
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

557
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,290
PROFESSOR: So that if you
rotated them both around

558
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,580
and you only wanted
to cover things once,

559
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,350
you would rotate halfway around.

560
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,070
Only by 180 degrees.

561
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,040
That's true.

562
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,379
But you can rotate around
as many times as you want.

563
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:56,920
You're still covering
the same thing.

564
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,870
Over and over and
over and over again.

565
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,570
So let's go on.

566
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,920
I have a very subtle point
that I need to discuss with you

567
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:23,640
in order to go on to
the next application.

568
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,820
So here's my, and
I do want to get

569
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,190
to the point of horizontal
cross-sections as well.

570
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,450
So let's continue here.

571
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,860
So the first thing that I
want to point out to you now

572
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:50,230
is, I want you to
beware of units.

573
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,570
There's something a little
fishy in this problem.

574
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:01,660
And it can be summarized in the
character of the answer, which

575
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,320
is just a little bit not clear.

576
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,860
Namely, it looks
like it's a^2, right?

577
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,710
And we know that a
is in units and we

578
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,950
should've gotten cubic units.

579
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,520
So there's something a little
bit tricky about this question.

580
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,190
And so I want to illustrate
the paradox right now.

581
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,050
So, suppose that a
= 100 centimeters.

582
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,080
And suppose the units
are centimeters.

583
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,610
Then the formula for the
volume is pi/2 100^2.

584
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,336
and the units we must take
are centimeters cubed.

585
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:41,710
Despite the fact
that you kind of

586
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,290
want to square the centimeters.

587
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,740
But that's not what
this problem says.

588
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,200
OK, so this is the
situation that we've got.

589
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,750
Now, if you work
out what this is,

590
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,710
to figure out what the
volume of this cauldron is,

591
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,010
what you find is that
it's pi / 2 times, well,

592
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:10,160
10^4 is 10 * 1,000
centimeters cubed.

593
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,410
And those are otherwise
known as liters.

594
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,560
So this is approximately
10 pi / 2 liters,

595
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,710
which is about 16 liters.

596
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,230
And so that's how much
was in the cauldron

597
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,190
under this choice of units.

598
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,010
Now, I'm going to make
another choice of units now.

599
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,420
And we're going to
make a comparison.

600
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,510
Suppose that the
units are 1 meter.

601
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,370
Looks like it
should be the same,

602
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:47,260
but if I calculate the volume,
it's going to be pi / 2,

603
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,610
and 1^2 times meters cubed.

604
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,600
That's what the
formula tells us to do.

605
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:04,860
And if you calculate that
out, that's pi / 2 (100 cm)^3.

606
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,660
And with this unit
notation we really do

607
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,240
want to cube the centimeters
and cube the 100.

608
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,880
So we get pi / 2.

609
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,540
And here we get 10 ^ 6 cm^3.

610
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:26,990
And that comes out to
pi / 2 * 1000 liters.

611
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:35,560
Or, in other words,
about 1600 liters.

612
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,420
So I'd like to ask you
first to contemplate this.

613
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,490
And this is a paradox.

614
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,360
And this is a serious paradox.

615
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,910
If you really want
to apply problems,

616
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,650
you actually have to understand
what your answers mean.

617
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,411
So what do you think
is going on here?

618
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:53,910
Yeah.

619
00:39:53,910 --> 00:40:06,916
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

620
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:07,540
PROFESSOR: Yes.

621
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:19,252
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

622
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:19,960
PROFESSOR: Right.

623
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,980
So the question is, how could
either of these make sense.

624
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,700
How am I dealing with
the units in either case.

625
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,700
So now I'm going to
explain to you the answer.

626
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,590
Because this is
really quite puzzling.

627
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,470
But it has a resolution.

628
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:49,220
The answer to this question is
that both answers are correct.

629
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,050
This is correct
reasoning in both cases.

630
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:00,080
What's the matter is that you
have to interpret the equation

631
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:13,800
y = x^2 in two different ways.

632
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,060
Two ways.

633
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,650
So let me explain what they are.

634
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:31,950
For instance, you can take
y = x^2 in centimeters.

635
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,610
So y = x ^2 in centimeters.

636
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:44,850
In which case, the picture
looks like the following.

637
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:49,100
a = 100 centimeters.

638
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:55,990
And this distance here, which
is the x value, this is 10.

639
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,810
This is 10 centimeters.

640
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,790
And that's what the
relationship means.

641
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,930
So the top of the
cauldron, if you like,

642
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,879
this distance here
is 20 centimeters.

643
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,670
This is actually very
badly drawn to scale.

644
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,890
It's actually very,
very, deep, this thing.

645
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,900
It's a rather skinny, deep one.

646
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:19,290
So this is very much not
to scale, this picture.

647
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:27,920
The other picture, the other
picture is interpreting y = x^2

648
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,350
in meters.

649
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,140
And that's more like what
I had in mind, actually.

650
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,340
I had in mind this big vat here.

651
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:46,530
And this distance
here is 1 meter,

652
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,440
and then the square
root of 1 is 1.

653
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,770
So this distance
here is also 1 meter.

654
00:42:52,770 --> 00:43:00,210
And the top is 2 meters.

655
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,410
Now, it's not that crazy.

656
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,410
And in fact it's easy to
check that, it's pretty

657
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,040
reasonable in terms of scale.

658
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,600
That this thing has
16 liters in it.

659
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:17,390
And this guy has
1600 liters in it.

660
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,370
So you actually have to
know what your symbols mean

661
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,120
when you're dealing with these
kinds of applied problems.

662
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,170
And if you're ever really going
to do some real consequences,

663
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,260
you have to know
what the units mean.

664
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,870
And the problem with the
equation y = x^2 is that

665
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,600
it's the one that
violated scaling rules.

666
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,100
Yeah.

667
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:47,264
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

668
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:47,930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

669
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,927
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

670
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:53,510
PROFESSOR: No.

671
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:59,300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

672
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:09,020
PROFESSOR: OK, so the question
is whether the formula V = pi /

673
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,520
2 a^2.

674
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,430
This is the correct
answer to the problem.

675
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,920
But it is not
consistent in units.

676
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,340
If you plug in a equals
some number of centimeters,

677
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,060
some number of millimeters,
some number of inches and so on,

678
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,380
every single time you'll
get a different answer.

679
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,160
And they're all inconsistent.

680
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,800
In other words, this
formula violates scaling.

681
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

682
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,240
PROFESSOR: If you study
each step correctly,

683
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,342
you will discover that these
are the consistent and correct

684
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:49,300
statements, what I'm
writing on the blackboard.

685
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,060
And this makes sense
in a unit-less sense.

686
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,850
But then if you actually stick
units on them, one of them,

687
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,200
they both are correct.

688
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,590
And one of them describes
this situation and one of them

689
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,850
describes this situation.

690
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:07,100
And it's a mistake to think
of this as being 1 meter

691
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,910
and cubing the meters.

692
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:20,420
That will be an error that
will cause you problems.

693
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,370
This 1 is just unit-less,
and then the meters cubed

694
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:30,320
got converted.

695
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,250
So I encourage you to
study this on your own.

696
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,770
So now I'm going to
introduce the next problem.

697
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,580
We'll have to
solve it next time.

698
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,160
But the reason why I spent
all the time on units

699
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,300
is that otherwise it
would be impossible

700
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,934
for you to believe me when
I do this next calculation.

701
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:48,350
Because we're
trying to get a real

702
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,360
answer out of a real question.

703
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,210
And I'm going to make
conversions between centimeters

704
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,080
and meters back and forth.

705
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
And we have to get it
consistent in order

706
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,200
to have the right answer.

707
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,420
So there was a reason for
illustrating this pitfall.

708
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,400
So this second, the next
thing that I'd like to do,

709
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:19,560
is I'd like to boil the water
in the witches' cauldron.

710
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,480
This is definitely
seasonally appropriate,

711
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,190
since we're
approaching Halloween.

712
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,500
And we'll work it
out fully next time.

713
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:35,260
Now, I'm going to
introduce another feature

714
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,301
into the problem.

715
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:38,550
And this is the one that I
want you to understand now.

716
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,527
We'll set it all up
tomorrow, but right now I

717
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,860
need you to understand what
the new main idea that we're

718
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:51,400
going to get.

719
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,590
There is the new
physical feature

720
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,170
that I'm going to add to this
problem is that if when you're

721
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:01,150
boiling, when the witches
are boiling this water,

722
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,070
the temperature of
the water is not

723
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,617
the same at each
level in the kettle.

724
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:08,950
At the bottom of the kettle,
where you're heating it up,

725
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,150
it's at its highest temperature.

726
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,291
So at the bottom it's going
to be, say, 100 degrees.

727
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,040
That is, it's going
to be totally boiling.

728
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,830
100 degrees Celsius.

729
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:30,690
And at the top, it's going
to be, say, 70 degrees.

730
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,150
Right, it's very cold outside.

731
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,420
In fact, it's 0 degrees outside.

732
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,920
Which is the temperature at
which all witches operate,

733
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,900
I think.

734
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,160
Anyway, so they're
boiling their stuff.

735
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,230
And the question that
we're going to ask

736
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:55,540
is how much heat, how much
heat, do they need to do it.

737
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,170
Now, the thing starts
out at 0 degrees Celsius.

738
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,820
And we're going to heat it up to
this temperature configuration

739
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,490
here.

740
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,750
But it's rising from 100
down here to 70 up here.

741
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,920
So the temperature
is varying in height.

742
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,660
And for simplicity
I'm going to make

743
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:19,700
the formula for the temperature
be 70 at the top and 100

744
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,440
at the bottom.

745
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,070
So it's going to be 100 - 30y.

746
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,240
We'll let the level be 1, here.

747
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,500
Sorry, 30.

748
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,160
I said 3-- I wrote
3, but I meant 30.

749
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,120
So this is the
situation that we have.

750
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,280
Now, the point
about this problem

751
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,170
is we're going to figure
out the total temperature,

752
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,920
the total amount of heat
that you need to add in order

753
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,010
to heat this thing up.

754
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,240
That's going to be
temperature times volume.

755
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,350
But some places will
count more than others.

756
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,720
These will be hotter, but
there's less water down here.

757
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,290
This is wider up here, so
there's more water up here.

758
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:05,610
So there are various things that
are varying in this problem.

759
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,450
Now, the only way to
set up so that it works

760
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:13,870
is to chop things
up horizontally

761
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,780
instead of vertically.

762
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,800
Because it's on the
horizontal levels

763
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,090
that the temperature
is constant.

764
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,010
So we'll have an
easy calculation

765
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:28,320
for how much it takes to heat
up a layer, a horizontal layer.

766
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,850
When we rotate this
guy around the y axis,

767
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,660
that is which kind of shape.

768
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,332
It's a disk.

769
00:49:37,332 --> 00:49:39,540
So actually this one's going
to be an easier problem.

770
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,820
It's going to be a disk
problem, not a shell problem.

771
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,111
But we're going to have to
work things out with respect

772
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:47,617
to the dy variation.

773
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,950
In other words, the integral
will be with respect to dy.

774
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,158
So we will do that next time.

775
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:56,410
We'll figure out how much heat
it takes to boil the kettle.
