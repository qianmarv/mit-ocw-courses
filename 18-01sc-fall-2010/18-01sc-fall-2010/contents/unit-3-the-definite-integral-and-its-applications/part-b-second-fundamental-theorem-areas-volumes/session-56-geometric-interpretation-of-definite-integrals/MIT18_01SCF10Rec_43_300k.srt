00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,360
PROFESSOR: Hi.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,010
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,550
We've been talking in lecture
about various different

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,840
applications of definite
integrals.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,450
And one of them has been that we
can use definite integrals

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,770
to find areas of regions that
previously we wouldn't have

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,550
been able to.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,710
So, one simple example of that
is that we can use a definite

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,210
integral to find the
area of a region

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,850
bounded between two curves.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,320
So I have an example of such
a question right here.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,000
So the question is to compute
the area of the region that's

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,780
bounded between the curves
y equals x cubed and y

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,930
equals 3x minus 2.

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,190
So one thing you'll notice is I
haven't given you endpoints

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,940
for this region.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,880
So I've just given you
the bound and curves.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,480
So one thing you're going to
have to do right at the

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,400
beginning is to figure out what
this looks like and what

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,040
region you're going to
be integrating over.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,330
What interval you're going
to be integrating over.

23
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,880
So, this is a kind
of tricky one.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,750
Why don't you pause the video,
think about it for a few

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,310
minutes, try and work it out
yourself, and you can come

26
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,960
back and we can try and
work it out together.

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:14,980

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,250
All right, welcome back.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,820
So hopefully you've had some
luck figuring out what this

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,870
situation looks like and then
computing the integral.

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,280
So let's talk about
it for a minute.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,020
So we have these two curves.

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,710
And so somewhere--

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,340
I'm asking about the region
bounded by them-- so what I'm

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,380
telling you is somewhere these
curves intercept and they

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,290
surround some bounded region.

37
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,860
And so I'm asking for what the
area of that region is.

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,780
So in order to figure that
out, we should figure out

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,700
where these curves intercept.

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,430
So to find the, in other words,
we need to find the

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,140
endpoints of the interval
over which

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,150
we're going to integrate.

43
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,840
So in order to that, we have to
solve for where we have the

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
intersection between y
equals x cubed and y

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,430
equals 3x minus 2.

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,860
So we have to solve
the equation.

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:13,700
So we need to solve the
equation x cubed

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,990
equals 3x minus 2.

49
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,230
Or x cubed minus 3x
plus 2 equals 0.

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,900
So this a polynomial equation.

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,150
It's not quadratic, right?

52
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,610
It's a cubic equation.

53
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,580
So that means it's hard
to solve in general.

54
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,520
Luckily in this case, it's,
there are some, there's a root

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,550
we can recognize
fairly easily.

56
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,740
Which is, it's pretty,
you know,--

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,460
one thing you can always do is
check small positive integers

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,120
or use the rational root
theorem, if you remember that

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,720
from high school math.

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,210
So in this case, if you check
x equals 1, it's fairly easy

61
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,230
to see that x equals 1 is
a root of this equation.

62
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,710
So in other words, we can factor
the left-hand side.

63
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,870
We can divide out a factor
of x minus 1.

64
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,780
OK, and so now we have to do
long division or synthetic

65
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,220
division, whatever kind of
division you want to divide

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,670
through here.

67
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,520
So we get x squared minus--

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,830
so we've got a nope, I lied.

69
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,570
Plus x minus 2 after
you divide.

70
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,340
How's that look?

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,956
We can just double-check.

72
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:28,180
You know, we get an x cubed
minus x squared plus x squared

73
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,580
minus 2x minus x plus 2.

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,510
OK.

75
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,760
So that adds up to
the right thing.

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,129
So we either have that 1 is a
root or that x squared you

77
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:45,080
know, rather for the places
where these intersect, we have

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,540
either x equals 1 or x squared
plus x minus 2 equals 0.

79
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,730
And now here you can, you know,
again factor or use the

80
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,820
quadratic equation
or what have you.

81
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,830
And you can see so we have
that this actually fully

82
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,520
factors as x minus 1 squared
times x plus 2 equals 0.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:11,940
Which means that we have
intersections when either x

84
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,440
minus 1 is 0 or when
x plus 2 is 0.

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:23,446
So intersections at x equals
1 and x equals minus 2.

86
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,650
All right.

87
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,010
So you can take that information
and you can, you

88
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,170
know, put it together and
you can make a nice

89
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,820
picture like this.

90
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,090
Or, I suppose, you could have
made the nice picture before

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,990
you had that information.

92
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,500
And so we see that we've
got this line, y

93
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,790
equals 3x minus 2 here.

94
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,160
And we have the curve
y equals x cubed.

95
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,490
And they have two intersection
points.

96
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,620
They intersect once.

97
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,280
Down at x equals minus
2, y equals minus 8.

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,790
And they intersect again
up at the point 1, 1.

99
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,280
And they're actually
tangent there.

100
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,300
So x cubed, the curve y equals
x cubed stays above the line

101
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,230
at this point.

102
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,310
So one way you can read that off
is here you had a double

103
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,513
root at minus 1, if you like.

104
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:11,660
But, OK, so then, the
region in question

105
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,670
is this region here.

106
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,550
So it's a region bounded between
those two curves that

107
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,290
we're trying to compute
the area of.

108
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,960
So now that we have the
endpoints this isn't such a

109
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,885
tricky problem at all.

110
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:23,310
Right?

111
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,760
so we've got the endpoints
and we know--

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,390
now that we've drawn this
picture-- we know which curve

113
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,205
is on top and which curve
is on bottom.

114
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,070
Right?

115
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,090
So the height, when we imagine
cutting this region into lots

116
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,470
of little rectangles or
approximate rectangles, the

117
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,450
height is going to be x cubed
minus 3x minus 2.

118
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,100
Minus the quantity 3x minus 2.

119
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,610
Right?

120
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,860
The x cubed is on top and 3x
minus 2 is on the bottom.

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,820
So the area is equal
to the integral.

122
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,970
OK, and now we know where we
have to integrate from and to.

123
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,440
So we're integrating from x
equals minus 2 to 1 to get

124
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,565
this whole region of
x cubed minus the

125
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:10,712
quantity 3x minus 2 dx.

126
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,090
OK?

127
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,610
Because the y equals x cubed
is the top curve.

128
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,430
And y equals 3x minus 2
is the bottom curve.

129
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,555
So this is the height of those
rectangles, which is positive.

130
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:26,030
OK, and so now, OK, well
now this is pretty

131
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,610
straightforward.

132
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,160
We're integrating a polynomial
at this point.

133
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,530
So this is the integral.

134
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,330
Well, OK, so integrating x
cubed, that gives me x to the

135
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,760
fourth over 4.

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,540
Integrating minus 3x gives me
minus 3x squared over 2.

137
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:51,030
And integrating plus 2 gives
me plus 2x between x equals

138
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,030
minus 2 and 1.

139
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,350
So OK, so now I just
do this difference.

140
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:04,520
So this is equal to 1/4 minus
3/2 plus 2 minus--

141
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,550
OK, now I put in minus 2 I get
2 to the fourth-- sorry--

142
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,970
minus 2 to the fourth is 16
over 4, so that's minus 4.

143
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,020
OK, minus 3 times
4 over 2 is 6.

144
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,510
And then plus 2 times minus
2 is minus 4 again.

145
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,150
OK, and now we've just
got some arithmetic.

146
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,600
So this all becomes a plus 6.

147
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,700
And I have to add everything
together.

148
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,090
So that's something like, well
I've got a denominator of 4,

149
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,390
so it's, yeah.

150
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,750
All right, so there's a secret
I should tell you.

151
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,010
Which is that mathematicians are
not actually very good at

152
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,540
arithmetic, usually.

153
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:55,520
So this is minus 6/4 plus
2 plus 6, so plus 8.

154
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,160
So this is 8 minus 5/4,
which is 6 and 3/4.

155
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,150
OK, that's 6 plus 3/4.

156
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,800
So 6 and 3/4.

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,460
This was just arithmetic.

158
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,420
Here was the calculus part.

159
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,650
And, in fact, you know, one
feature of a problem like this

160
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,290
is that you have a fair amount
of work sometimes to see the

161
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,740
picture of what you're
working with.

162
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,530
Then the integration here was
pretty straightforward.

163
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,630
Right?

164
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,820
This was a fairly easy
integral to compute.

165
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,850
If you're, say, better at
fraction arithmetic than I am,

166
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,050
at least.

167
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,250
So, there you go.

168
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,150
So, we had this region.

169
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,940
So we found, actually the
endpoints of the interval.

170
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,520
We found which was the
top curve and which

171
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,550
was the bottom curve.

172
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,350
And that led us right
down this integral.

173
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,900
And then that integral was
fairly easy to compute from

174
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,080
that point out.

175
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,710
And then we ended up with
this as our final area.

176
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,380
So I'll end there.

177
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,599
