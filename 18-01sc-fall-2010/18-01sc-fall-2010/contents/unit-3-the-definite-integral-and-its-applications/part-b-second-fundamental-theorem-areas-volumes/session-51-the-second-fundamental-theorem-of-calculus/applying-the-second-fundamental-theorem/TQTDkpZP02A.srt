00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,570
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,720
In this video I want us to
work on the following problem.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,400
So we're going to assume little
f is a continuous function.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,380
And if we know that the integral
from 0 to x of f of t dt

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,470
is equal to x
squared sine pi x, I

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,305
want us to find little f of 2.

7
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:28,930
So I'm going to give
you a little while

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,080
to work on the problem.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,990
When you're ready, come
back and we'll take a look

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,130
at how I do the problem.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,010
Welcome back.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,510
So again, we're
working on a problem

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,800
where we know that f is
a continuous function.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,450
We know that the integral
from 0 to x of f of t dt

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,820
is equal to a certain function.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,477
And we want to find f of 2.

17
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:57,060
So what we're going
to use, because we

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,050
know little f is
continuous, we can actually

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,520
use the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,650
And we know that d/dx
of this whole expression

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,950
here is actually little f of x.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,925
So let's just remind us--
I'll write it down formally.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:26,395
FTC implies that d/dx, the
interval from 0 to x f of t dt

24
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,186
is equal to f of x.

25
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:27,686
Right?

26
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,960
We know that.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,680
So, we know that d/dx
of the right-hand side

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,190
and d/dx of the left-hand
side are the same.

29
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,910
And so we know that if we take
d/dx of the right-hand side,

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,040
we'll get little f of x.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,200
Because d/dx of the left-hand
side of this equation

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,680
is little f of x.

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,430
So d/dx of the right-hand
side is also little f of x.

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,360
So now what we
have to do is apply

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,900
what we know about taking
derivatives to find little

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,090
f of x.

37
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,630
Then once we find
little f of x we

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,880
can evaluate it at f equal 2,
at 2-- sorry-- at x equal 2.

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,210
Sorry about that.

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,370
So let's come over to the
right part of the board

41
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,530
and we'll find d/dx
of this function here.

42
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:22,830
So what do we have to use?

43
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,496
We have to use the
product rule and then

44
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,420
we'll have to use a little chain
rule, a really simple chain

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,286
rule in the second term.

46
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm going to write
it down below,

47
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,770
so we have some room here.

48
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,550
So the first term,
we get 2x sine pi*x.

49
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,690
The second term
we get x squared.

50
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,010
Derivative of sine is cosine.

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,690
pi*x.

52
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,210
And then we have
to pull out a pi.

53
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,940
Which I'll just put, well I'll
put it here for the moment.

54
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,980
The pi comes from taking
the derivative of pi*x.

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,670
And now all we need, this
is then f of x, right?

56
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,610
So I just will remind
us this is f of x.

57
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,920
Let me put it right
here, a little f of x.

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,570
So if I want to find f
of 2, all I have to do

59
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,100
is evaluate this at x equal 2.

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,450
So f of 2 is going to
equal-- 2 times 2 is 4--

61
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:20,050
sine 2*pi plus 4-- I'll
bring the pi in front--

62
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,040
4*pi cosine 2*pi.

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,610
So what do I get?

64
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,010
Sine 2*pi is 0.

65
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,970
Cosine 2*pi is 1.

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,669
So ultimately, I just get 4*pi.

67
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,710
So, hopefully you were
able to solve this problem

68
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,950
and get the same answer.

69
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,220
Now let me remind you,
one more time what we did.

70
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,440
Let's come over here.

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,410
We started with a function
that we knew was continuous.

72
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,760
We knew the integral from
0 to x of that function

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,610
was equal to a
certain function of x.

74
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,447
And we wanted to evaluate
this function at a certain,

75
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:55,430
at a certain point.

76
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,430
So what we exploited was
the fundamental theorem

77
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,986
of calculus.

78
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,610
And the fundamental
theorem of calculus

79
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,010
tells us that d/dx of the
left-hand side is f of x.

80
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,260
And so that we can take
d/dx of the right-hand side

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,070
and figure out what f of x is.

82
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,290
And then we just evaluate.

83
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,240
So I think I'll stop there.
