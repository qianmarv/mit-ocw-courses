00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,570
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to recitation.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,720
In this video I want us to work
on the following problem.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,635
So we're going to assume
little f is

5
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:16,400
a continuous function.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,660
And if we know that the integral
from 0 to x of f of t

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,880
dt is equal to x squared
sine pi x, I want us to

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,940
find little f of 2.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,930
So I'm going to give
you a little while

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,080
to work on the problem.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,470
When you're ready, come back and
we'll take a look at how I

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,720
do the problem.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:43,070

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,040
Welcome back.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,600
So again, we're working on a
problem where we know that f

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
is a continuous function.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,850
We know that the integral from
0 to x is f of t dt is equal

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,820
to a certain function.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,500
And we want to find f of 2.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,710
So what we're going to use,
because we know little f is

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,570
continuous, we can
actually use the

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,520
fundamental theorem of calculus.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,770
And we know that d dx of this
whole expression here is

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,950
actually little f of x.

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,960
So let's just remind us--

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,210
I'll write it down formally.

27
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,380

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:26,570
FTC implies that d dx, the
interval from 0 to x f of t dt

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,186
if equal to f of x.

30
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:27,272
Right?

31
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:29,960
We know that.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,590
So, we know that d dx of the
right-hand side and d dx of

33
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,190
the left-hand side
are the same.

34
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,910
And so we know that if we take
d dx of the right-hand side,

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,040
we'll get little f of x.

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,810
Because d dx of the left-hand
side of this equation is

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,680
little f of x.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,430
Do d dx of the right-hand side
is also little f of x.

39
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,230
So now all we have to do is
apply what we know about

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,090
taking derivatives to
find little f of x.

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,205
Then once we find little f of
x we can evaluate it at f

42
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:04,880
equal 2, at 2--sorry--
at x equal 2.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,210
Sorry about that.

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,550
So let's come over to the right
part of the board and

45
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,530
we'll find d dx of this
function here.

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:21,870

47
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,830
So what do we have to use?

48
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,090
We have to use the product rule
and then we'll have to

49
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,290
use a little chain rule, a
really simple chain rule in

50
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,290
the second term.

51
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,910
I'm going to write it
down below, so we

52
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,770
have some room here.

53
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,550
So the first term, we
get 2x sine pi x.

54
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,690
The second term we
get x squared.

55
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,010
Derivative of sine is cosine.

56
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,690
pi x.

57
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,210
And then we have to
pull out a pi.

58
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,940
Which I'll just put, well I'll
put it here for the moment.

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,980
The pi comes from taking
the derivative of pi x.

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,670
And now all we need, this
is then f of x, right?

61
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,610
So I just will remind
us this is f of x.

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,920
Let me put it right here,
a little f of x.

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,290
So if I want to find f of 2, all
I have to do is evaluate

64
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,100
this at x equal 2.

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,060
So f of 2 is going to equal--

66
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,450
2 times 2 is 4--

67
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,560
sine 2 pi plus 4--

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,050
I'll bring the pi in front--

69
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,040
4 pi cosine 2 pi.

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,610
So what do I get?

71
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,010
Sine 2 pi is 0.

72
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,970
Cosine 2 pi is 1.

73
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,860
So ultimately, I
just get 4 pi.

74
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,090
So, hopefully you were able to
solve this problem and get the

75
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,950
same answer.

76
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,220
Now let me remind you, one
more time what we did.

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,440
Let's come over here.

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,410
We started with a function that
we knew was continuous.

79
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,280
We knew the integral from 0 to
x of that function was equal

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,610
to a certain function of x.

81
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,621
And we wanted to evaluate this
function at a certain, at a

82
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,530
certain point.

83
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,840
So what we exploited was the

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,030
fundamental theorem of calculus.

85
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,700
And the fundamental theorem of
calculus tells us that d dx,

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,010
of the left-hand
side is f of x.

87
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,460
And so that we can take d dx
of the right-hand side and

88
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,070
figure out what f of x is.

89
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,290
And then we just evaluate.

90
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,240
So I think I'll stop there.

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,855
