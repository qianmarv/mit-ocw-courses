00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,370
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to recitation.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,760
Today in this video, what I'd
like us to do is work on some

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,340
solid of revolution problems.
Well, one solid

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,820
of revolution problem.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,080
So what I want us to do in this
one is, find the volume

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,740
of the solid generated by
rotating the region bounded by

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,330
these three curves, x equals 0,
y equals 5, and y equals x

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,090
squared plus 1, about
the y-axis.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,250
And I'm forcing you--
or I'm requesting--

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,950
that you use the disk method.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,770
So I want us to work on the
disk method in this case.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,960
So why don't you take a
crack at the problem?

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,210
And then I'll be back.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,100

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,460
OK, welcome back.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,330
So what we're going to do is
we're going to work on finding

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,190
the volume of a solid generated
by rotating this

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,380
region that's bounded by the
three curves mentioned about

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,310
the y-axis.

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,660
And as I said before, we're
going to use the disk method.

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,670
So when you're solving these
problems, the first thing you

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,230
want to do is give yourself at
least a rough sketch of what

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,590
this region looks like, of with
the region bounded by

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,440
these three curves actually
looks like.

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,500
So the first thing I'm going
to do before I do anything

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,330
else, is at least get a rough
sketch of what that region

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:22,690
looks like.

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,010
And I'll do that over
here on the right.

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,090
So, let's see.

31
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,990
We know we've got the region--

32
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,480
let me actually even use some
different colored chalk.

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,130
We'll say the x equals 0
is actually the y-axis.

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,900
That's x equals 0.

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,500
And then y equals 5--

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,140
actually we'll put that in last.
But y equals x squared

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,260
plus 1 is the parabola
y equals x squared

38
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,720
shifted up by 1.

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,610
So if this is y equals 1,
then it's just roughly

40
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,300
something like this.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,830
That might not look like
the best parabola

42
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,600
I've ever seen, but.

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,120
Well, something roughly
like that.

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,160
Maybe, as I said,
rough sketch.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,540
Maybe more like that.

46
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,150
And then, we want to also put in
the y equals 5, which I'll

47
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,690
say is roughly about here.

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,950

49
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,310
So I could--

50
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,280
notice I've got these
three curves.

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,850
This curve, this curve,
this curve.

52
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,620
So I'm interested in this
region right here.

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,870
Right?

54
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,820

55
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,470
Notice that if I also include
this region, when I rotated

56
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,800
that around, I'd actually get
the same solid, whether I

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,490
included this region or not.

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,700
But in terms of doing the
integration, I want to make

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,090
sure I don't count
anything doubly.

60
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,710
So I'm just looking at what
happens when I take this piece

61
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,260
and I rotate it around
the y-axis.

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,080
So what do we want to do?

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,750
We said we want to use
the disk method.

64
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,560
Which means ultimately, I'm
looking for finding out what

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,495
the radius is.

66
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:55,390
Right?

67
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,570
I'm doing pi r squared
when I integrate.

68
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,690
So I'm interested in finding
this length--

69
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,790
that's going to be
our radius--

70
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,330
and then we rotate--

71
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,910
you probably can't see that;
so let me just say that's

72
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,840
going to represent our radius.

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,850
And then when we rotate
that around the

74
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,150
y-axis we get our disk.

75
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,570
Right?

76
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,170
We've seen some pictures
of this before.

77
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,305
So I'm interested in
this length here.

78
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:24,250
And because I want to use the
disk method, I'm forcing us to

79
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,040
figure out what is this
value in terms of y?

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,920
So we know we have, well we know
that y equals x squared

81
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,170
plus 1 there.

82
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,300

83
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,556
So in terms of y, this is y
minus 1 equals x squared.

84
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:45,920
So the square root of y
minus 1 is equal to x.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,820
So this is the expression I'm
interested in as our radius,

86
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,210
as my radius.

87
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,260
Right?

88
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,240
And now, what I need to do is
figure out, I know if this is

89
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,650
the radius I need to figure out,
since I'm doing this in

90
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,010
terms of y, what this lower
bound is for y and what the

91
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,470
upper bound is for y.

92
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,070
And then I'm going to be
integrating pi times the

93
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,930
radius squared over y, over
the changes in y.

94
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,350
Now let's see.

95
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,240
This one's easy. y
equals 5 up here.

96
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,570
And what is this value here?

97
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,720
Well, the function that I
had here was y equals x

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,040
squared plus 1.

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,290
So when x is 0, y is 1.

100
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,660
So this is the value
where y equals 1.

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,590
So I know what I'm interested
in doing.

102
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,125
Again, let me write it down.

103
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:40,730
Is I'm integrating from 1
to 5 of pi r squared dy.

104
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,440
And now, I need to write
r as a function of y.

105
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,270
So r is square root
of y minus 1.

106
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,190
When I square that, I
just get y minus 1.

107
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,070
So what I'm really interested
in integrating is, the

108
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,320
integral from 1 to 5 of--

109
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,990
let me put the pi outside,
because who cares--

110
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,460
pi times that integral,
y minus 1 dy.

111
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,900
And if I actually evaluate
this, figure out, if I

112
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,120
actually take the integral, use
my rules for polynomials,

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
I can get a numerical value.

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,290
I'm going to stop evaluating
here, because from here on I

115
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,800
know you guys can do it.

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,340
But, the point of this problem,
what I want to

117
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,480
mention, the point of this
problem is the main thing we

118
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,190
had to do is figure out what is
the radius in terms of y.

119
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,320
That was the main thing we had
to figure out in order to do

120
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
this problem.

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,890
I said you had to use disks.

122
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,520
So we had to figure out what the
radius was in terms of y.

123
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,820
And then we had to figure
out what the bounds

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,150
were in terms of y.

125
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,370
And once we do that, it's a
simple matter of evaluating

126
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,580
this integral, or finding the
actual value for what this

127
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,060
integral is.

128
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,780
So I think that is
where I'll stop.

129
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,154
