00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:07,560
PROFESSOR: Hi.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,140
Welcome back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,210
Today we're going to do another
example of a definite integral.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,220
This time, it's going
to be one that you're

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,329
going to need to do
some substitution for.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,370
You're not going to know
the antiderivative right

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,820
off the top of
your head, I think.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,710
So, I've got it on
the board behind me.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,760
So it's compute the
integral from minus 2 to 2

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,500
of the function x squared
cosine of the quantity

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,570
x cubed over 8 dx.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,430
So, this is a kind
of a weird integrand.

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,380
Roughly, you know,
very, very rough graph

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,740
of kind of what it looks like.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,600
So this is sort of the
area of this region.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,870
It's a positive function
over this interval.

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,700
So it's the area of this region
that I'm asking you to compute.

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,690
So, all right, so
definite integral.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,950
Why don't you pause the
video, take a couple minutes,

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,689
work this out
yourself, come back, we

21
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,730
can work it out together.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,890
All right, welcome back.

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,750
So, from looking at
this integrand here,

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,610
it seems to me that I
don't know immediately

25
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,620
off the top of my head
what its antiderivative is.

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,760
So, I can't just sort of
apply the fundamental theorem

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,437
of calculus directly without
a little bit of work.

28
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:22,020
So there are two
different ways that I

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,188
can go about computing
this then, about computing

30
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,250
this definite integral.

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,770
One is, that I can
forget for the minute

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,760
that it's a definite integral
and compute the antiderivative

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,180
and then use the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,270
So, let's try that way first and
then we'll do it a second way

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,930
as well.

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:56,620
So, method one is to
compute the antiderivative.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,600
So we compute the
antiderivative of x squared

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,404
cosine of x cubed over 8 dx.

39
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,320
So here, it's not a
definite integral anymore.

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,410
Now I'm just looking
at the antiderivative.

41
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,660
And so, OK, so
either by intelligent

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,544
guessing or that--
I forget if that's

43
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:18,960
what Professor
Jerison called it--

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,580
or by just a
substitution method.

45
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,860
So, a good thing
to substitute here,

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,200
is we see inside this function
we have this x cubed part

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,670
and then outside we
have an x squared part.

48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,360
So x squared dx,
that's closely related

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
to the differential of x cubed.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,940
So we might try
the substitution--

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,184
we might try the substitution
u equals-- well we can maybe

52
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:45,850
get rid of all of
that at once-- so make

53
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,970
u equals x cubed over 8.

54
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:57,550
So in that case, du is
equal to 3/8 x squared dx.

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,820
And so this integral is equal
to the integral of-- well so,

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,130
x squared dx, we have that.

57
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,730
So we need to multiply
and divide by 3/8.

58
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:16,470
So this is, 8/3 cosine of u du.

59
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,132
All right, and so
now, OK, so the 8/3,

60
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,090
that's just a constant.

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,089
That pulls out in front.

62
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:22,140
That's not hard.

63
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,540
So then the
antiderivative of cosine

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,820
u du, that's something we know.

65
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:37,246
So this is 8/3 of minus
sine-- sorry not minus;

66
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:39,620
I was doing the derivative
instead of the antiderivative.

67
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,280
Just 8/3 sine u.

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,780
OK.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,215
And good.

70
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:46,090
So that's the anti--
plus the constant, which

71
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,355
we don't need
because we're going

72
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:49,479
to plug this in the
fundamental theorem of calculus

73
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,100
in a minute.

74
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,640
So it's 8/3 sine u.

75
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,290
And, OK, so, but
that's not good.

76
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,706
I need it back in
terms of my x's.

77
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,410
And so I have to
back-substitute.

78
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:08,930
So this is 8/3 sine
of x cubed over 8.

79
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,540
All right, now I've
got an antiderivative

80
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,560
of this expression.

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,410
So now I can take
this antiderivative

82
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,270
and apply fundamental
theorem of calculus, Right?

83
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,192
So, the integral
from minus 2 to 2

84
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:31,915
of x squared cosine of x cubed
over 8 dx is equal to-- well

85
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:38,312
it's equal to this
antiderivative-- 8/3 sine x

86
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:48,480
cubed over 8 taken between x
equals minus 2 and x equals 2.

87
00:04:48,480 --> 00:05:00,670
So this is equal to 8/3 times
sine of 1 minus 8/3 times

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,720
sine of minus 1.

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,230
OK, and sine of minus x
is equal to minus sine x.

90
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:14,396
So we could rewrite this
as 16/3 times sine of 1.

91
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,270
So that's the answer.

92
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,490
That's the value
of this integral.

93
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,520
And we did this first
method by first computing

94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,740
the antiderivative
and then using it

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,530
with the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

96
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,570
The second way we
can do it is the one

97
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,570
that we just learned
more recently in lecture.

98
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,540
Which is to use
substitution directly

99
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,010
in the definite integral.

100
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,640
So let me come over
here and do that.

101
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,690
So, method two.

102
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,150
So now, when we do it this way,
mostly this looks the same.

103
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,670
So we start off, we don't
go back to antiderivative.

104
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,514
We start off with the
definite integral.

105
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,555
So that's one difference.

106
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,780
We can use the exact
same substitution.

107
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,000
So we can use exactly
the substitution

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,740
that we used before, which
was u equals x cubed over 8.

109
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,880
That doesn't change.

110
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,950
And we still have the same du
is equal to 3 x squared over 8,

111
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,345
but what does
change-- sorry, dx.

112
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,190
Good.

113
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,830
You need a differential always
to be equal to a differential.

114
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,767
So what does change
is that this-- I need

115
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,642
to change the bounds.

116
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:48,290
Right?

117
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,498
If I'm keeping it as definite
integrals all the time,

118
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:54,330
so I'm changing here from
an integral with respect

119
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,060
to x to an integral
with respect to u.

120
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,780
And so that means
that when I write down

121
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,810
the second integral
with respect to u,

122
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,410
the bounds that I write down
have to be the bounds for u.

123
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,430
Not for x.

124
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,610
So when x is equal
to minus 2, I need

125
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,220
to know what the
corresponding value of u is.

126
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,620
So in this case, when
x is equal to minus 2,

127
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,820
we see that the
lower bound here--

128
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,970
when x is equal to minus
2-- the lower bound on u

129
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,220
becomes u equals, well,
minus 2 cubed over 8.

130
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,650
That's minus 1.

131
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,140
And when x is equal
to 2, the upper bound,

132
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,030
u becomes 2 cubed over 8.

133
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,170
So u becomes 1.

134
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,530
So we have this extra step
when we do it this way,

135
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,990
of changing the bounds.

136
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,310
OK, so I do that.

137
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,850
So now I get the integral.

138
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,780
So I'm going to write
u equals minus 1

139
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,070
here just to remind myself
that I made this change to 1.

140
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,000
OK, and now the inside
transforms exactly the same.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,340
So it's 8/3 times cosine u du.

142
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,650
OK, and now again, this is
something for which I already

143
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,910
know the antiderivative.

144
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,880
So I apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus here.

145
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:13,600
So I get the integral is
equal to 8/3 sine of u,

146
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,210
where u goes between
minus 1 and 1.

147
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,120
So the other thing that's
changed here is that now I

148
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,800
don't have to change this
back in terms of x's.

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,050
I have the values that I'm
going to plug in here already

150
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,250
in terms of u.

151
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,410
So I don't have to switch
back in terms of x's.

152
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,870
And so I just plug these values
in and take the difference.

153
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:42,770
So this is equal to 8/3 sine
of 1 minus 8/3 sine of minus 1,

154
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:49,119
which as we said before
is 16/3 times sine of 1.

155
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,910
OK, so we have these
two different methods.

156
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,980
They're very, very, very,
similar in how you apply them.

157
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,590
The key differences
are, that when

158
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,140
you do it, the substitution in
terms of definite integrals,

159
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,400
you have to change your
bounds of integration.

160
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,680
And what you get for changing
your bounds of integration is

161
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,960
at the end you don't have to
switch back from u's into x's.

162
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,820
Whereas, if you do it by first
computing the antiderivative,

163
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,090
well, you don't have any
bounds of integration

164
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,840
when you compute the
antiderivative so you

165
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,090
don't have to change them.

166
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,390
But once you computed
the antiderivative,

167
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,490
then you have to go and
make your back substitution.

168
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,340
Put everything back in
terms of x's before going on

169
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,450
to compute the definite
integral that you started with.

170
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,380
So the those are the
two different ways
