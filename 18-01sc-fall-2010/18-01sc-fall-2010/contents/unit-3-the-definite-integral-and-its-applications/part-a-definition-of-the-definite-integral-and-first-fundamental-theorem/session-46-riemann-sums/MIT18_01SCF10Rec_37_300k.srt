00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,060
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to recitation.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,960
In this video, what we'd like to
do is find the volume of a

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,190
paraboloid--

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,830
this one that I've drawn
on the board--

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,160
using what we know about Riemann
sums and integrals.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,890
And so, this paraboloid, just so
you understand, what we do

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,990
is we take the curve y equals
x squared and we rotate it

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,380
around the y-axis.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,860
And we're looking in particular,
from height, the

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,220
height of capital H. So from 0
to capital H, that's what our

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,110
y value is ranging over.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,250
And what we'd like to do is find
the volume enclosed by

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,650
the rotation of y equals x
squared around the y-axis.

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,370
So what I'd like you to do is
to think about how you could

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,690
write the volume
as an integral.

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,780
And I would suggest that you
think about integrating in the

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,740
y variable as opposed
to the x variable.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,550
So we're going to do it
in the y variable.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,420
So I'll give you a little while
to think about that.

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,110
Start as a Riemann sum, take
it to an integral, and then

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,890
I'll come back and show
you how I did it.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:12,030

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,320
OK, welcome back.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,680
So again, what we're trying to
do is find the volume of this

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,320
paraboloid.

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,890
And we're hoping to write it
as an integral in the end.

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,490
So I'm going to give us a little
understanding of how we

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,490
start the process.

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,880
And what I want to do is break
up this paraboloid first, into

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,060
our first-best guess.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,810
And I'm going to estimate the
volume using four different--

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,610
I'm breaking it up into
four pieces, so

34
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,960
I'll use four cylinders.

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,240
So let me actually just
draw these cylinders.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,346
So I'm going to start
at the top radius.

37
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,910
And that would maybe be
my first cylinder.

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,990
And then the next radius would
be the one down here.

39
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,250
Actually maybe I can
alternate color.

40
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,620
You'd be able to see them
a little better.

41
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,060
The next radius would actually
be this one kind of right here

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,470
coming around that way, going
down, so it sticks out a

43
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,205
little bit from there.

44
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,270
Let me just kind of shade
that lightly.

45
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,470
And the next one is using
this cylinder.

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,545
So that's our diameter here.

47
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,795
And then the last one--

48
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,570

49
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,990
well, that doesn't
look very even.

50
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,680
But we'll just say that there
are four to keep it with four.

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,590
I'll say the last one is
starting right here.

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,840
So I don't have to draw
any more pictures.

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,780
And the last one is
that cylinder.

54
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,430
So there are four
cylinders here.

55
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,360
This one comes around behind.

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,510
There are four cylinders here.

57
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,575
There's the blue one here, a
white one, a red one and

58
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,580
another blue one.

59
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,970
And I can actually estimate the
volume of this paraboloid

60
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,900
by finding the volume
of these cylinders.

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,400
So we have to understand
how to find the

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,840
volume of the cylinders.

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,470
And then what we'd like
to do is to get better

64
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,570
approximations, we're going to
make these cylinders flatter.

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,670
So we're going to make
them not as tall.

66
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,190
And then as they get flatter and
flatter and flatter, we're

67
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,870
going to get better and better
estimates of the

68
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,230
paraboloid's volume.

69
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,320
And then in the limit, we will
get the volume of the

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,110
paraboloid.

71
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,090
So this again should remind you,
this sounds a lot like

72
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,010
Riemann sums. What we've been
doing with Riemann sums.

73
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,340
You're adding up your estimating
area under the

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,830
curve in the case that you've
seen mostly in class.

75
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,020
But maybe this reminds you of
the volume of the pyramid

76
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,880
problem that you saw on
the lecture videos.

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,240
So it's very similar
to that idea.

78
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Now let's figure out how we can
write this sum of these

79
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,270
four cylinders in terms of y.

80
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,250
So what do we need to do?

81
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,790
Well, first we're going to
designate the height of the

82
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,860
cylinder as delta y.

83
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,080
That's the change in y.

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
That does not look like a y.

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,230
Let me try that again.

86
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,986
Delta y.

87
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:38,270
OK.

88
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,840
So each height-- and even though
it doesn't look like

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,420
it, we're going to say that
they're evenly divided.

90
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,360
So let's make, in your mind
this one should be a bit

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,270
bigger and this one should
be a bit smaller.

92
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,220
So delta y is going
to be a constant.

93
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,555
And then I have to figure
out the radius.

94
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,560
Right?

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Well, we know that at
height y the radius

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,345
squared is height y.

97
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:01,190
Right?

98
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,500
r squared equals h.

99
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,770
So what I actually need is that
at height h, or at height

100
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,982
y, the radius is square root y.

101
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,240
Right?

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,520
So at height y radius is
the square root of y.

103
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,980
So when I want to look
at the volume of the

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,080
cylinder at height y--

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,075
I'm using the upper value here--
so at height y, what is

106
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:30,140
the volume of the cylinder?

107
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,040
We know in general the volume
is equal to pi r squared h.

108
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,160
And so, the height here of the
cylinder-- this is not the

109
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,320
height on the whole thing; this
is the height of that

110
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,830
individual cylinder--

111
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,530
the height of the cylinder
is delta y.

112
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,350
And r is square root y.

113
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,530
So r squared is just y.

114
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:51,270
So the volume of a single
cylinder is pi y delta y.

115
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,540
So again, we find the volume of
this cylinder by taking the

116
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,320
y value here, multiplying it by
pi and then multiplying it

117
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,380
by delta y.

118
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,390
And I do that for this
one, this one, this

119
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,850
one, and this one.

120
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,840
And then I add them up.

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,870
And that's my estimate of
the volume of the whole

122
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,530
paraboloid.

123
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,420
So now what can I do?

124
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,510
Well, again, I mentioned
we can divide into more

125
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,310
subintervals.

126
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,680
And let's say we only divide,
let's say we divide it into n

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,210
subintervals. right?

128
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,030
What would this look like?

129
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,150
I'm going to be taking a sum
to find the volume of the

130
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,280
whole thing.

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,690
I'm going to take a sum from
i equals 1 to n of

132
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,190
these kinds of things.

133
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,200
Pi, y sub i delta y.

134
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,030
So each y sub i represents the
y value at the different

135
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,930
height where I'm taking
my cylinder.

136
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,440
Now delta y, in this case,
if I divide into n equals

137
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,470
subintervals, delta y
is H divided by n.

138
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,470
And then you can actually
figure out the y

139
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,990
sub i's from that.

140
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,790
The first one would
be H over n.

141
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,580
The second one would be 2H over
n and so on until the top

142
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,730
one would be Hn over
n and you'd have

143
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,800
H as the top height.

144
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
So those are the values that
we're ranging over.

145
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,880
And now, as we let n go
to infinity, this

146
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,730
is our Riemann sum.

147
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,570
This is actually going
to be an integral.

148
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,170
Delta y goes to dy.

149
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,690
And let's look at
what happens.

150
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,050
So we get dy here.

151
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,150
We're going to have
an integral.

152
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,600
And what are we actually
evaluating?

153
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,040
We're evaluating the function
pi y at what places?

154
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,780
Well, as delta y goes to 0,
the first value of y sub i

155
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,050
that I get is pushing
down to 0.

156
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,680
And the last value we know is H.
So we're actually taking an

157
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,320
integral from 0 to
H of pi y dy.

158
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,330
And that is the integral
representation of the volume

159
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,590
of the paraboloid.

160
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,130
Now this is a very easy thing to
take an integral on, so you

161
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,290
could actually evaluate
this and find it.

162
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,790
I believe you'll get something
like pi y squared over 2 from

163
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,260
0 to H. So you should get
something like pi over 2

164
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,550
capital H squared.

165
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,230
You can check my math, but
I think that's correct.

166
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,350
So that is actually the volume
of the paraboloid carved out

167
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,820
by this particular curve, y
equals x squared, from, or at

168
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,520
height capital H. So that's
where we'll stop.
