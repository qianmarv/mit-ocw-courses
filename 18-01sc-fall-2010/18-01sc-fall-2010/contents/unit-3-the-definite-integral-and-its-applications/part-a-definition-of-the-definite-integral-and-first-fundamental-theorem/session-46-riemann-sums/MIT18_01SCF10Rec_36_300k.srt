00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,250

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,960
PROFESSOR: Welcome back
to recitation.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,490
Today what I'd like to do is
work on using Riemann sums to

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,360
approximate definite
integrals.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,610
So, what we're going to do first
is I'm going to let you

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,340
work on the problem.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,400
So, let me state the problem.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,900
I'll give you a little
time to work on it.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,940
And then I'll come back.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,620
So the problem is
the following.

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,530
We want to use four subintervals
and left

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,600
endpoints to approximate the
following definite integral:

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,150
the integral from minus 1 to
3 of the function x cubed.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,000
And I've drawn a rough sketch
of what x cubed, y equals x

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,410
cubed looks like to help you
out as the starting point.

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,265
So why don't you use the four
subintervals and left

17
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,990
endpoints to approximate the
definite integral, then I'll

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,750
come back and show
you how I do it.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:56,360

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,600
OK, welcome back.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,470
So what we want to do again,
is use Riemann sums to

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,620
approximate this defnite
integral.

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,380
And I've given you the
specifications of four

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,070
subintervals and
left endpoints.

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,060
So I'm going to draw what these
four subintervals and

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,540
their left endpoints are going
to give us on the graph.

27
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,290
Then we're going to calculate
what the actual value is of

28
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,930
this estimate.

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,870
And then I'll show you a way
you can write it in some

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,010
different notation.

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,732
So let me actually find
some blue chalk.

32
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:22,956
Excuse me.

33
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:27,580
So, using blue chalk I'm going
to show you where the four

34
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,910
subintervals and the
left endpoints.

35
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,480
So it's minus 1 to 3, so I've
conveniently done it so we

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,220
have every unit length is one
of the seven intervals.

37
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,120
They're all unit length.

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,990
And if I want left endpoints,
then my rectangle's heights,

39
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,800
if you remember, are going to be
the output at the left side

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,330
of the interval.

41
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,820
So I'm going to designate the
left interval's outputs.

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,990

43
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,900
And what do we have here?

44
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,340
I'm going to now draw rectangles
of those, using

45
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,930
those with the one side on
x-axis and one side at the

46
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,200
height of the left
endpoint output.

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,940
So there's one rectangle.

48
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,180
Oh, I almost did something
wrong here.

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
This left endpoint's rectangle
has no height.

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,370
Because the left endpoint's
value is 0.

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,620
The output is 0.

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,680

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,030
There's another rectangle.

54
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,433
And there's the last
rectangle.

55
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:30,060

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,510
So, to designate everything
carefully, I will call this

57
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,120
value y0, the output
value here y0.

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,370
This value will be y1.

59
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,730

60
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,010
The output value here
will be y2.

61
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,480

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,040
And to show exactly what do I
mean by output value, here I

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,270
have enough room to write
the height is really

64
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,860
what it is, is y3.

65
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,350
So y0, y1, y2 and y3 designate
the heights of these four

66
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,570
rectangles.

67
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,770
And the length of each
rectangle, if you remember, is

68
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,150
really what we designate
as delta x.

69
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,610
So this right here is delta x.

70
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,610
And in this case delta x is
each time equal to 1.

71
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,790
So, remember formally, what we
want to do is, if we want to

72
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,160
find this definite integral, we
want to find the area under

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,560
the curve between the x-axis
and the function x cubed.

74
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
And remember this
is sined area.

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,350
So anything below the x-axis
has a negative sign

76
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,170
associated to it.

77
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,340
Anything above the x-axis
has a positive sign

78
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,830
associated to it.

79
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,800
So, when I'm trying to determine
this, when I'm

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
trying to do an estimate, I'm
finding the areas of these

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
rectangles.

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,080
So my first approximation that
I've given here, is we want

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,390
the four subintervals and
the left endpoints.

84
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,410
What we really need is this
delta x, which is the base,

85
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,460
times the height, which is y0,
y1, y2 and y3 of each of these

86
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,950
rectangles.

87
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,030
So, to write it carefully--

88
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,600
well I guess this won't be the
most careful way we write it--

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,240
but I have the base, which is
delta x in each case, times y0

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,770
plus y1 plus y2 plus y3.

91
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,760
And the only thing I have to be
careful of is that the area

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,190
of the rectangle here
will be negative.

93
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,680
But how do I pick that up?

94
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,150
I pick that up because
this y0 value as an

95
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,470
actual output is negative.

96
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,680
So that actually will be picked
up automatically by the

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,870
value of the output
on the function.

98
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,200
So let's evaluate these things.
y0 should be the value

99
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,520
of the function at x
equal negative 1.

100
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,460
When x is negative 1, the
function, remember, is x

101
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,880
cubed, so I get negative
1 cubed, which is

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,690
just negative 1.

103
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,790
So delta x is 1.

104
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,900
y0 is negative 1.

105
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,370
y1 is the value the function at
x equals 0, because my left

106
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,450
endpoints are minus
1, 0, 1 and 2.

107
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,000
So the second one is
0 is the input.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,190
at x equals 0 I get
0 as an output.

109
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,890

110
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,950
The y2 is going to be this
third left endpoint.

111
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,790
That's at x equal 1.

112
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,900
1 cubed is 1.

113
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,180
So I get a 1 there.

114
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,310
And then, the third left
endpoint, I had

115
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,000
minus 1, 0, 1, 2.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,950
So the third left
endpoint is 2.

117
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,480
2 cubed is 8.

118
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,190
And so y3 is 8.

119
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,670
Hopefully the subscripts here
didn't confuse you because I

120
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,500
actually was very close to
having the subscripts

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,630
represent the x value.

122
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,540
But that's not in fact what
the subscripts are doing.

123
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,155
The subscripts are just
representing what interval we

124
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:35,130
are looking at.

125
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,820
So the four intervals are
designated by 0, 1, 2 and 3.

126
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,360
So I get, when I put this all
together I get 1 times--

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,690
well, minus 1 plus 1 is 0--

128
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,790
1 times 8.

129
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,000
So I get 8.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
And if I wanted to look at
the picture, how is that

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,870
represented?

132
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,770
Well this rectangle has
base 1 and height 8.

133
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,510
So that has area 8.

134
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,960
This rectangle is actually
a square.

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,750
It has base 1, height 1.

136
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,920
And this one is also a square.

137
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,030
It has base 1, height 1.

138
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,210
But because it's below, it has a
minus sign associated to it,

139
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,370
when I think about it
in terms of area.

140
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,740
So I get minus 1
plus 1 plus 8.

141
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,680
And that's where the
8 comes from.

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,000
Now if I wanted to write this in
terms of a Riemann sum, you

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,960
see them sometimes written
in this way.

144
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,232
You can think about it in a
formal sum in this way.

145
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:27,900
You've probably seen
this in the lecture

146
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,360
videos more like this.

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:38,160
The sum from i equals 0 to 3
of f of x sub i delta x.

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
And now, in this case, we could
even be more deliberate

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,970
if we wanted to.

150
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,910
And we could let x sub i be
designated by some value.

151
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,840
We could say, starting at
negative 1 and adding some

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,280
number to it each time based
on the interval.

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,430
But this is sort of the easiest
way to write out what

154
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,430
we're interested in.

155
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,620
And then the x sub i's are
going to be designated

156
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,330
separately.

157
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,600
We can write x sub 0 is
equal to minus 1 x sub

158
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,280
1 is equal to 0.

159
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,682
x sub 2 is equal to-- sorry,
not minus 1-- is

160
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,510
equal to plus 1.

161
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,170
An x sub 3 is equal to 2.

162
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,030
So in that case, that's what
we would get there.

163
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,790
And we could write it
in that way and then

164
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,590
get the same values.

165
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,150
So I think I will stop there.

166
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,378
