00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,060
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,310
In this video, what
we'd like to do

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,190
is find the volume
of a paraboloid--

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,280
this one that I've drawn
on the board-- using

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,160
what we know about Riemann
sums and integrals.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,520
And so, this paraboloid,
just so you understand,

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,040
what we do is we take the
curve y equals x squared

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,380
and we rotate it
around the y-axis.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,680
And we're looking in
particular, from height--

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,840
the height of capital H,
so from 0 to capital H,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,110
that's what our y-value
is ranging over.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,110
And what we'd like to do
is find the volume enclosed

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,650
by the rotation of y equals
x squared around the y-axis.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,320
So what I'd like you
to do is to think

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,690
about how you could write
the volume as an integral.

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,480
And I would suggest
that you think

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,990
about integrating in the
y variable as opposed

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,740
to the x variable.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,550
So we're going to do
it in the y variable.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,716
So I'll give you a little
while to think about that.

21
00:00:57,716 --> 00:01:00,440
Start as a Riemann sum,
take it to an integral,

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,890
and then I'll come back
and show you how I did it.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,986
OK, welcome back.

24
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,360
So again, what
we're trying to do

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,320
is find the volume
of this paraboloid.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,890
And we're hoping to write it
as an integral in the end.

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,330
So I'm going to give us a
little understanding of how

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,490
we start the process.

29
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,540
And what I want to do is break
up this paraboloid first,

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,060
into our first-best guess.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,810
And I'm going to estimate the
volume using four different--

32
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,390
I'm breaking it up
into four pieces,

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,960
so I'll use four cylinders.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,240
So let me actually just
draw these cylinders.

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,346
So I'm going to start
at the top radius.

36
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,824
And that would maybe
be my first cylinder.

37
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:46,990
And then the next radius
would be the one down here.

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,871
Actually maybe I
can alternate color.

39
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,620
You'd be able to see
them a little better.

40
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,365
The next radius would
actually be this one kind

41
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:57,710
of right here coming around
that way, going down,

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,205
so it sticks out a
little bit from there.

43
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:03,270
Let me just kind of
shade that lightly.

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,470
And the next one is
using this cylinder.

45
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,210
So that's our diameter here.

46
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,990
And then the last one-- well,
that doesn't look very even.

47
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,570
But we'll just say
that there are four.

48
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,950
To keep it with four,
I'll say the last one

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,590
is starting right here.

50
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,840
So I don't have to
draw any more pictures.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,780
And the last one
is that cylinder.

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,430
So there are four
cylinders here.

53
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,260
This one comes around behind.

54
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,510
There are four cylinders here.

55
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,551
There's the blue one here,
a white one, a red one

56
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,580
and another blue one.

57
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,970
And I can actually estimate
the volume of this paraboloid

58
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,840
by finding the volume
of these cylinders.

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,340
So we have to
understand how to find

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,607
the volume of the cylinders.

61
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:45,190
And then what we'd like to do
is to get better approximations,

62
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,570
we're going to make
these cylinders flatter.

63
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,670
So we're going to
make them not as tall.

64
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,070
And then as they get flatter
and flatter and flatter,

65
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,986
we're going to get better
and better estimates

66
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:55,230
of the paraboloid's volume.

67
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,750
And then in the
limit, we will get

68
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,110
the volume of the paraboloid.

69
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,651
So this again should
remind you, this

70
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,344
sounds a lot like Riemann sums.

71
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,010
What we've been doing
with Riemann sums.

72
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,070
You're adding up--
you're estimating area

73
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,736
under the curve, in
the case that you've

74
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:07,611
seen mostly in class.

75
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:09,277
But maybe this reminds
you of the volume

76
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,880
of the pyramid problem that
you saw on the lecture videos.

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,240
So it's very similar
to that idea.

78
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,500
Now let's figure out how we can
write this sum of these four

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,209
cylinders in terms of y.

80
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,250
So what do we need to do?

81
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,520
Well, first we're going
to designate the height

82
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,860
of the cylinder as delta y.

83
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,080
That's the change in y.

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
That does not look like a y.

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,230
Let me try that again.

86
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,986
Delta y.

87
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:38,270
OK.

88
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,010
So each height-- and even
though it doesn't look like it,

89
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,302
we're going to say that
they're evenly divided.

90
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:45,760
So let's make, in your mind
this one should be a bit bigger

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,301
and this one should
be a bit smaller.

92
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:50,220
So delta y is going
to be a constant.

93
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,555
And then I have to
figure out the radius.

94
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,560
Right?

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,345
Well, we know that at height y
the radius squared is height y.

96
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:01,190
Right?

97
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,500
r squared equals h.

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,220
So what I actually need is that
at height h, or at height y,

99
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,982
the radius is square root y.

100
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,240
Right?

101
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,254
So at height y radius
is the square root of y.

102
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:22,420
So when I want to look at
the volume of the cylinder

103
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,610
at height y-- I'm using the
upper value here-- so at height

104
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,140
y, what is the volume
of the cylinder?

105
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,040
We know in general the volume
is equal to pi r squared h.

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,780
And so, the height here
of the cylinder-- this

107
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,560
is not the height
on the whole thing;

108
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,830
this is the height of
that individual cylinder--

109
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,530
the height of the
cylinder is delta y.

110
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,350
And r is square root y.

111
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,530
So r squared is just y.

112
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:51,196
So the volume of a single
cylinder is pi y delta y.

113
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:53,070
So again, we find the
volume of this cylinder

114
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,800
by taking the y-value
here, multiplying it by pi

115
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,309
and then multiplying
it by delta y.

116
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,850
And I do that for this one, this
one, this one, and this one.

117
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,840
And then I add them up.

118
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,530
And that's my estimate of the
volume of the whole paraboloid.

119
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,420
So now what can I do?

120
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,060
Well, again, I mentioned we can
divide into more subintervals.

121
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,560
And let's say we
only divide-- let's

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,947
say we divide it into
n subintervals. right?

123
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,030
What would this look like?

124
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,610
I'm going to be
taking a sum to find

125
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,280
the volume of the whole thing.

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm going to take a sum
from i equals 1 to n

127
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,190
of these kinds of things.

128
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,200
Pi y sub i delta y.

129
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,720
So each y sub i represents the
y-value at the different height

130
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,930
where I'm taking my cylinder.

131
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,830
Now delta y, in this
case, if I divide

132
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,470
into n equal subintervals,
delta y is H divided by n.

133
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,990
And then you can actually figure
out the y sub i's from that.

134
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,790
The first one would be H over n.

135
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,700
The second one would be 2H over
n and so on until the top one

136
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,680
would be H*n over n and you'd
have H as the top height.

137
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
So those are the values
that we're ranging over.

138
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,670
And now, as we let
n go to infinity,

139
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,730
this is our Riemann sum.

140
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,570
This is actually going
to be an integral.

141
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,170
Delta y goes to dy.

142
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,690
And let's look at what happens.

143
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,817
So we get dy here.

144
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,150
We're going to have an integral.

145
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,650
And what are we
actually evaluating?

146
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,040
We're evaluating the
function pi y at what places?

147
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,310
Well, as delta y goes to
0, the first value of y

148
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,050
sub i that I get is
pushing down to 0.

149
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,590
And the last value we know is
H. So we're actually taking

150
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,320
an integral from
0 to H of pi*y*dy.

151
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,840
And that is the
integral representation

152
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,590
of the volume of the paraboloid.

153
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,940
Now this is a very easy
thing to take an integral on,

154
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,290
so you could actually
evaluate this and find it.

155
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:50,030
I believe you'll get something
like pi y squared over 2 from 0

156
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,630
to H. So you should
get something

157
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,550
like pi over 2
capital H squared.

158
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,230
You can check my math, but
I think that's correct.

159
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,350
So that is actually the volume
of the paraboloid carved out

160
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,180
by this particular
curve, y equals

161
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,660
x squared, from, or
at height capital H.

162
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,520
So that's where we'll stop.
