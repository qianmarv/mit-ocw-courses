CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
In this video I want
to explain to you

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,310
where the coefficients
we saw in Simpson's rule

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,010
actually come from.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,620
So what I'm going to do is
take this curve that I have

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,970
and show you what the picture
of Simpson's rule does.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,570
And then I'm actually going
to determine explicitly where

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,300
the coefficients come from.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,570
So let's look at
this picture first.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,585
The picture I have here, the
white curve is going to be my y

11
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:39,159
equals f of x function.

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,450
And so, if you remember, what
Simpson's rule is saying,

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,270
you have to have two delta x's.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,610
So in this case h
is equal to delta x.

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,230
So what Simpson's rule is saying
is I can find, approximate,

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,310
the area under this
curve from minus

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,680
h to h by a certain expression.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,520
And the expression is, I
said delta x is equal to h,

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,066
so let me write h over 3 times
y_0 plus 4*y_1 plus y_2-- oh,

20
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:09,566
y_2.

21
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:15,032
So that's what you got--

22
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,490
that's what you
saw in the lecture,

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,802
that this is what
the coefficients are.

24
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,510
So I want to explain
why this is a 1, why

25
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,915
that's a 4, why that's a 1,
and where that 3 comes from.

26
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,540
The picture is not
going to explain it,

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,740
but the picture will help
us understand how to go.

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,530
So what Simpson's rule does is
it takes those three points,

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,170
so the (x_0, y_0) the (x_1,
y_1) and the (x_2, y_2)

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,370
that are on the curve
y equals f of x.

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,860
And it finds a parabola
through those three points.

32
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,590
So I'm going to do my best to
draw what looks like a parabola

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,140
through those three points.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,870
Something-- I'll draw it lightly
first and then I'll fill it in.

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,610
Something along these lines.

36
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,560
Something like that.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,610
That's a, sort of
looks like a parabola.

38
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,260
And so the idea
is Simpson's rule

39
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,777
is saying I can find the
area under the blue curve.

40
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:16,610
So I can find the area
under the blue curve.

41
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,540
So this is a function, we'll
call this y equal P of x.

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,130
And that's what you were
actually told about in lecture.

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,575
That you're approximating
your function y

44
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:34,610
equals f of x by a
quadratic function that

45
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,020
goes through the values
(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1),

46
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,160
and (x_2, y_2).

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,750
And then you find the
area under that parabola.

48
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,990
Between minus h and h.

49
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,890
Now this picture, you
might say, Christine,

50
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,807
this looks really
like a bad estimate.

51
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:52,890
This looks kind of stupid.

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,931
Maybe you should have
picked a different function

53
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,790
to estimate this.

54
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,940
And I did this one because I
wanted to be zoomed out far

55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,650
and to show you, to give you
a little intuition about what

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,190
happens when we make h smaller.

57
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,810
Notice that if I
cut the size of h

58
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,540
in half, so if I started
with here was minus h to h,

59
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,540
what would my three points be?

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,750
My three points would be
this point, y_1, and y_2

61
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,920
would be right here.

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,660
Well the quadratic
through those points

63
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,870
is much closer to
the actual function.

64
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,460
And if I cut that in half
again, I'd have points here,

65
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,890
here, and here.

66
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,730
Something like that,
and that starts

67
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,660
to look almost exactly
like a quadratic.

68
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,222
So if I found the
area under this--

69
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:36,680
or if I wanted to
estimate the area

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,070
under this piece
of the curve using

71
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,170
a quadratic through
those three points,

72
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,280
they would be very close.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
So don't be alarmed
by Simpson's rule

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,371
as an approximation based
on this large picture.

75
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,620
So now, what do we have to do?

76
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,703
Remember, what's our goal?

77
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,280
Our goal is to figure out where
the coefficients come from.

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,970
So what I actually
need to do is I need

79
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,870
to evaluate a certain integral.

80
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,220
Or I need to integrate
a certain function.

81
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,650
I need to integrate P of x.

82
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,220
So what I'm going to be finding
through the rest of this video,

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,310
is the integral from
minus h to h of P of x dx.

84
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,750
And my goal is to show
that this integral is

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,840
equal to this expression.

86
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,235
I want to show that
these are equal.

87
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:20,860
That's my goal.

88
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,305
So let's get down to it.

89
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:26,930
What do I know?

90
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,780
What's the only thing I know
right away about P of x?

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,166
I know I'm choosing it to
be a quadratic function

92
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,165
and I know it goes through
three certain points.

93
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,390
Right?

94
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,210
I'll write down what the three
points are when we need them.

95
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,330
But first let's just
say, in general,

96
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,010
let's take this integral
for a general quadratic

97
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,690
and see how much information
we actually need.

98
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,940
So let me come over here.

99
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,304
Actually, let me say first, what
do I mean my general quadratic?

100
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,220
I mean something of the
form big A, capital A,

101
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,990
x squared plus B*x plus C.
So I'm not filling in values

102
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,950
for these coefficients yet.

103
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,870
Those coefficients are coming
exactly from my three points.

104
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,850
(x_0, y_0), (x_1,
y_1), and (x_2, y_2).

105
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:14,950
So let's just integrate
that from minus h

106
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,812
to h first and see what
kind of information we need.

107
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:19,770
So if I come over here.

108
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:32,570
So what do I get when I
actually integrate this?

109
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,180
Well, I get A x to
the third over 3,

110
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,724
plus B x squared
over 2, plus C*x,

111
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,640
and then I have to
evaluate from minus h to h.

112
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,520
Well, if you were
thinking about this,

113
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,000
it shouldn't be surprising
that when I do this,

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,080
there's not going
to be a B term.

115
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,840
Why is that?

116
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,790
Well, these two
functions are even.

117
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,172
A x squared and C
are even functions.

118
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,880
And I'm integrating
over something that's

119
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,130
symmetric about the y-axis.

120
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm going from minus h to h.

121
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,460
So if you think
about A x squared,

122
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,960
and I'm going from
minus h to h, I'm

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,430
finding the area under a
quadratic, from minus h to h,

124
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,200
it's going to be twice
the area from 0 to h.

125
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,470
But B*x, that's a
line with slope B.

126
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,410
If I wanted to integrate
B*x from minus h to h,

127
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,670
that's the area, the signed area
under the curve, of a line B*x,

128
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,770
from minus h to h.

129
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,120
If I just draw a quick picture,
what does that look like?

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,970
It's symmetric with respect
to a rotation there.

131
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,210
I'd have this signed area.

132
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,960
This is the curve y equals B*x.

133
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,420
From minus h to h, I get
this area is negative

134
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,470
and this are is positive
and they're equal.

135
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,940
So, what I'm about to do,
you shouldn't be surprised

136
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,100
there won't be a B term.

137
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,370
So what do we actually
get when we evaluate this?

138
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,470
We get 2A h cubed,
over 3, plus 2*C*h.

139
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,390
That's what we get.

140
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,723
You can actually work it all,
put in all the h's and see

141
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,860
that, but I knew I was
going to have double

142
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,660
what was here when I
evaluated at h, and nothing

143
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,870
from the B term.

144
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,400
So we're getting closer.

145
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
We're getting closer.

146
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,113
We might not look like
we're getting closer,

147
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:24,320
but we're getting closer.

148
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,210
So let's simplify this
expression a little bit.

149
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,680
Actually, what I ultimately need
to do is I need to figure out C

150
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,870
and I need to figure
out something over here.

151
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,960
I need to actually
figure out A h squared.

152
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,080
And let me explain why I need
to figure out A h squared.

153
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,790
In the end, if I come
over back to what

154
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,620
I want to show-- let me
even box it, so we see it--

155
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,340
I want to show that
this integral, which

156
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,360
I've started to calculate,
is equal to h over

157
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,100
3 times this quantity.

158
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,610
So I want to keep
one around, but I

159
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,600
want the other, any
other powers of h

160
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,440
to not be there when I'm done.

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,940
Right?

162
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,290
I need one power of h there.

163
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,570
In fact I need an
h over 3 there.

164
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,540
So I think what I'll
do is I'll start off

165
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,470
and I'll pull out an
h over 3, and then

166
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,320
I'll try and figure out if I can
get the rest of my expression

167
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,220
to look like what's
in the parentheses.

168
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,140
That's really, ultimately,
what I'd like to do.

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,130
So let's come back over here.

170
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,355
I'm going to pull out an h
over 3 from both of these

171
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:23,146
and we're going to see
what we end up with.

172
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:28,359
OK so if I pull out an h over
3 here, what do I end up with?

173
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:28,900
This is easy.

174
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,340
That's 2A h squared.

175
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,340
And this one's a
little bit trickier.

176
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,470
But I have to multiply by
3 over 3 to get a 3 there.

177
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,570
So I end up with 6C.

178
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,250
OK.

179
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,041
Let's make sure I didn't
make any mistakes.

180
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,660
If I multiply through here
I get 2A h cubed over 3.

181
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,790
If I multiply through here I
get 2h*C. Looking good so far.

182
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,295
Now I have to figure out A and
C, or A h squared and C. Well,

183
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,970
C is pretty easy to find.

184
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,550
Let's think about why that is.

185
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,200
I have this polynomial.

186
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,840
The polynomial was equal to--
if we come over here and we look

187
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,730
again, it's A x squared
plus B*x plus C.

188
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,350
And the polynomial has to go
through those three points I

189
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,340
had.

190
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,120
So when x is 0, P of 0
is C. So let's come back

191
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,190
and look at our picture.

192
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,240
When x is 0, what's the
output on the white curve?

193
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,640
It's y_1.

194
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,290
So C is exactly y_1.

195
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,910
How am I going to
find A h squared?

196
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,940
Well, what I need to do is
use these other two points.

197
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm going to evaluate the
function P of x at minus h.

198
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,510
And its output has to be y_0.

199
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,430
And I'm going to evaluate
the function P of x at h

200
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,054
and its output has to be y_2.

201
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:51,970
So we're going to come
over to the other side,

202
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,780
but that's really
what we're doing next.

203
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,900
So let's come over here
and let's evaluate P of h

204
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,590
and P of minus h.

205
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:12,290
So P of h is A h
squared plus B*h plus C.

206
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:23,240
And P of minus h is A h
squared minus B*h plus C. OK.

207
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,740
What else?

208
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,340
Again we said this one
has to be y_2, the output,

209
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,300
and this one has to be y_0.

210
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,420
Because the output
at h has to agree

211
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,530
with the output of
the function f of x.

212
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,530
And its output at h was y_2.

213
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,080
The output at minus
h of P has to be

214
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,490
the same as the output
at minus h of f.

215
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,644
And that was y_0.

216
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,310
Now this might not
look fun yet but what

217
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,350
if I add these two
things together.

218
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,440
What happens?

219
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,110
I get 2A h squared.

220
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,270
These drop out.

221
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:06,980
And then I get plus 2C
is equal to y_0 plus y_2.

222
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,060
I'm getting closer.

223
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,610
I'm getting much closer.

224
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,300
Because now notice what I have.

225
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,412
I have 2A h squared,
I can isolate that.

226
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,370
And that's something that
I want to figure out.

227
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,786
I want to figure
out 2A h squared.

228
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:20,620
So let's figure
out what that is.

229
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:29,140
2A h squared is equal to
y_0 plus y_2 minus, well

230
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,640
what did we say C was?

231
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,210
C was the output at x equals 0.

232
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,240
Which is y1.

233
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,840
So it's minus 2C, which is minus
2y_1 So now we're very close,

234
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,740
we're very close to
getting what we want.

235
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,716
And that's good, because
I'm almost out of room.

236
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:47,090
So let's take that
expression, we

237
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,450
were working on this
expression right here,

238
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,930
and let's start to
fill in what we get.

239
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,260
We get h over 3
times 2A h squared,

240
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,030
which is y_0 plus
y_2 minus 2y_1,

241
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,980
and then I have to add 6C.

242
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,010
Now what's C?

243
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,970
C is y_1.

244
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,390
So I'm going to add 6y_1.

245
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:18,940
And if I simplify that, I
get y_0-- bingo-- plus 4y_1

246
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,770
plus y_2.

247
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,290
And that's what we wanted.

248
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,090
So let me take us through
kind of where all this came

249
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,920
from again, what the big pieces
were and we'll see now we

250
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,330
understand how we do Simpson's
rule, and these small chunks

251
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,680
of Simpson's rule.

252
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,388
So let's come back to
the very beginning.

253
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,570
OK, in the very beginning,
what we had was a function

254
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,120
f of x, that was
the white curve.

255
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,270
y equals f of x was
the white curve.

256
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,590
And then I found
a quadratic that

257
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,597
went through minus h, y0,
(0, y_1), and (h, y_2).

258
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:55,930
Went through those three points.

259
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,314
And I called that
quadratic P of x.

260
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:00,730
And then what I
was doing, we know

261
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,720
Simpson's rule says find the
area under the curve of P

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,190
of x between minus h and h.

263
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,390
So what I did was
I came over here

264
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,640
and I said OK, P of x, integral
of P of x from minus h to h.

265
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,200
I wrote P of x in a
very general form.

266
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,900
And then I actually
found an integral.

267
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,275
I came through and
after writing it out,

268
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,400
calculating the integral,
I got to this expression.

269
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,180
This is actually the integral
of P of x from minus h to h.

270
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,900
So it's the area under the curve
of P of x from minus h to h

271
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,270
is that.

272
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,680
And now I had to
figure this out,

273
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,250
how to write this in terms
of the outputs of f of x.

274
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,340
Which were y_0, y_1, and y_2.

275
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,550
Those were the ones
we were interested in.

276
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,270
So I ultimately knew I wanted
an h over three in front.

277
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,160
I knew I wanted my integral
in my quadratic to be

278
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,940
h over 3 times something,
so I pulled out an h over 3,

279
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,144
and then I looked at
what this expression was.

280
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,560
And if I could get
this expression

281
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
to look like the inside
of what I wanted,

282
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,460
which was y_0 plus 4y_1
plus y_2, I was in business.

283
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,300
And so then I used
outputs that I

284
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,190
knew for P of x to
find 2A h squared

285
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,720
and to find C. I know P of h
is the output of the f of x

286
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,560
function at the far
right, which was y_2.

287
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,710
And I knew P of minus h
was the output of the f

288
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,070
of x function at the far left.

289
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,500
That's y_0.

290
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,600
I actually then evaluate
P at h and minus h,

291
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,220
and when I add those together,
I get my 2A h squared

292
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,600
in terms of y_0, y_1, and y_2.

293
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Let me do this in terms
of y_0, y_1, and y_2.

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,972
Because I also knew C was y_1.

295
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,180
We talked about that as well.

296
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,820
C had to be y_1.

297
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,000
So I can then do the
substitution I need right here

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,640
and show where the coefficients
in Simpson's rule come from.

299
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,390
So hopefully that was
informative for you.

300
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,990
And I think I'll stop there.
