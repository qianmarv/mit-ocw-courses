8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,900
PROFESSOR: Now, today I need
to get started by finishing up

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,480
what I did last time.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,560
Namely, talking about
numerical methods.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,680
And I want to just
carry out one example.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,660
And then I want to
fill in one loose end.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:48,870
And then we'll talk
about the unit overall.

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:01:01,720
We were talking, last time,
about numerical integration.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm going to illustrate this
just with the simplest example

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,960
that I can.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,070
We're going to look at the
integral from 1 to 2 of dx / x.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,720
Which we know
perfectly well already

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,310
is the log of x evaluated
between 1 and 2, which is ln 2

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,250
- ln 1.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,080
Which is just ln 2.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,750
Now, if you punch that
into your calculator,

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,610
you're going to get
something like this.

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:41,030
I hope I saved it here.

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,530
Yeah.

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:53,250
It's about 0.693147.

27
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,150
That's more digits than we're
going to get in our discussion

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,650
here.

29
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:02,490
Anyway, that's about
how big this number is.

30
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,390
And the numerical
integration methods

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,760
will give you about as
much accuracy as you

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,270
can get on the function itself.

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,100
And, of course,
some functions we

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,040
may have more trouble
approximating.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,400
But the function 1 / x, we
know pretty well how to do,

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,440
because we know how to divide.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,410
So since the function that
we're integrating here is 1 / x,

38
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,874
it's going to be not
too difficult to get

39
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:29,540
some arithmetic.

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,740
Nevertheless, I'm
going to do this

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,210
in the simplest possible case.

42
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:44,040
Namely, just with two intervals.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,020
Now, you really can't expect
things to work so well

44
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,040
with two intervals.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,560
That's a pretty ridiculous
approximation to your function.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,830
When you have two
intervals, that

47
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,490
means you're looking at the
graph of this hyperbola.

48
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,510
And you have 1 here, and you
have 2 here and you have 3/2.

49
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,910
And you're really only
keeping track of the values

50
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,880
at these three spots.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,630
So the idea that you can
approximate the area just

52
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,940
by knowing the values
of three places

53
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,120
is a little bit of a
stretch of the imagination.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,850
But we're going
to try it anyway.

55
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:33,320
Now, the trapezoidal rule
is the following formula.

56
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,980
It's delta x (1/2 the first
value + the second value

57
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,290
+ 1/2 the third value).

58
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,930
In this case, the pattern
is 1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1/2.

59
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,540
And in this case, delta x =
1/2 because this interval's

60
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,120
of length 1.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
The b - a, right.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,990
Let's just point that out here.

63
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,410
Here, b = 2. a = 1. b - a = 1.

64
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,500
And the number n is 2.

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:16,160
And so, delta x, which
is (b - a) / n, is 1/2.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,580
So here's what we get.

67
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,850
And let's just see
what this number is.

68
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,540
It's 1/2 of the value at here.

69
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
Well, so let's just check
what these values are.

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,560
This value is 1, this
value over here is 2/3,

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,320
and the last value is 1/2.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,766
Because the function, of
course, was y = 1 / x.

73
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,640
And those were the three
values that we have.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,030
So y_0, this one is
y_0, this one is y_1,

75
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,480
and this one is y_2.

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:05:00,780
Now, here we have 1/2*
1 + 2/3 + 1/2 * 1/2.

77
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,900
Now, on an exam,
I don't expect you

78
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,930
to add up long messes
of numbers like this.

79
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,700
When you have two
numbers, I expect

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,670
you to add them up if they're
reasonable, or subtract them.

81
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,530
Just as we do when we
take antiderivatives.

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,660
Like, for example,
I don't want you

83
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,860
to leave the answer to
an integration like this

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,490
in this form.

85
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,514
I want you to simplify
it at least down to here.

86
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,180
And I of course don't
expect you to know

87
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,880
the numerical approximation.

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,417
But I certainly expect
you to be able to do that.

89
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,000
On the other hand,
when the arithmetic

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,360
gets a little bit long,
you can relax a little bit.

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,210
But I did carry this
out on my calculator.

92
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:41,240
Unless I'm mistaken,
it's about 0.96.

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,820
It's pretty far off.

94
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,484
So remember what it was.

95
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:49,650
It's what you get when you
get these straight lines.

96
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,170
And there are these little
extra pieces of junk there.

97
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,870
Now, don't trust that
too much, but the point

98
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,540
is that it's far off.

99
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:09,760
So now, let's take a
look at Simpson's Rule.

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,500
And I claim that Simpson's
Rule is surprisingly accurate.

101
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
In this case, really,
even a little more than it

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,410
deserves to be.

103
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:29,400
The formula is (delta x
/ 3) (y_0 + 4 y_1 + y_2).

104
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,460
So the pattern is
1, 4, 1, or 1, 4

105
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:39,200
and then it alternates 2's and
4's until 4, 1 at the very end.

106
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,060
And if I just plug in the
numbers now, what I get

107
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,340
is 1/6, because
delta x = 1/2 again.

108
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,600
And the value for y_0 was 1.

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,120
And the value for y_1 was 2/3.

110
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,350
And the value for y_2 was 1/2.

111
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,740
So here's the
estimate in this case.

112
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,540
And this one I did
carry out carefully.

113
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:16,880
And it came out to 0.69444.

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,810
Which is actually
pretty impressive,

115
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,490
if you think about it.

116
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,050
Given what the logarithm is.

117
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,740
Now, what's going on with
Simpson's Rule in general

118
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,240
is this.

119
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:43,360
If you-- Simpson's
minus the exact answer,

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,970
in absolute value, is
approximately of the size

121
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,850
of (delta x)^4.

122
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,730
That's really the
way it behaves.

123
00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:03,300
Which means that if
delta x is about 1/10,

124
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,670
so if we had divided this
up into 10 intervals,

125
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,270
which we didn't, but if
we'd divided it up into 10

126
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,585
intervals, then you could
expect that delta x--

127
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:15,320
the error would
be about 10^(-4).

128
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,090
In other words, four digits of
accuracy here for this thing.

129
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,940
But the exact analysis of
this, a more careful analysis

130
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,640
of this, is in your textbook.

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,820
And I'm not going to do it.

132
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,750
But I just want to point out
that it is an effective method.

133
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,830
It really does give
you nice four-digit

134
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,510
with manageable-- you could
even really do it by hand.

135
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,040
It's so convenient,
the Simpson's Rule.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,140
Whereas the other rules
aren't really that impressive

137
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,790
as far as giving fairly
accurate answers.

138
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,330
The last little
remark to make is

139
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,520
that the reason is
that Simpson's Rule is

140
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,300
matching a parabola.

141
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,650
And somehow the parabola
follows this curve better.

142
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,890
It's giving the exact answer.

143
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,570
So I'll mention this.

144
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:23,590
Simpson's Rule is derived
using the exact answer

145
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:32,770
for all degree 2 polynomials.

146
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,680
In other words, parabolas.

147
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,410
All parabolas.

148
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,450
But even all the
ones of lower degree.

149
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,360
So straight lines would
work, and constants

150
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,390
would work as well.

151
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,770
Whereas the other ones only
work for, say, straight lines.

152
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,200
The trapezoidal rule only
works for straight lines.

153
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,110
But there is a weird accident.

154
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,650
It turns out that it
also works for cubics.

155
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,460
Once you get the formulas,
it works for cubics.

156
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:06,630
So it's also exact for cubics.

157
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,400
And that's what explains
the fourth order validity.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,900
The last thing that
I want to point out

159
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,820
is that this is extremely
vague, what I said there.

160
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,340
And you should be a little
bit cautious about it.

161
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:30,890
You need to watch out
for 1/x for x near 0.

162
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,120
All bets are off if the
function is singular.

163
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,250
And there's a lot
of area under there.

164
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,740
And it's also true that if
the derivative messes up,

165
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,770
you're in trouble too.

166
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,480
You really need for the function
to be nice and smooth in order

167
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,700
for Simpson's Rule to work.

168
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,740
This is wath out.

169
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:55,920
That's a real wath out, but
we'll try to-- Watch out.

170
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,290
Watch out for whenever x near 0.

171
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,770
Then this thing doesn't work.

172
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,710
This thing really depends
on bounds on derivatives.

173
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,780
But I'm going to be
relatively vague about that.

174
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:12,780
I'm not attempting to give
you an error analysis here.

175
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,520
OK, so if you were
doing this on an exam,

176
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,600
how do you remember this
strange pattern of numbers?

177
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,250
The one thing that I want to
recommend to you is, as a way

178
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:35,620
of remembering it, so
the one mnemonic device,

179
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,340
we'll call it a
mnemonic device here,

180
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,850
for remembering what it
is that you're doing,

181
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,990
is to remind yourself of
what happens for the simplest

182
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,060
possible case.

183
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,730
Which is f(x) = 1.

184
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,260
It seems very modest, but
if it doesn't give you

185
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,410
the exact answer
for f(x) = 1, you've

186
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,220
got the wrong weightings.

187
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,120
And here, if you check out what
happens in the first formula

188
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,110
here, y_0 / 2 + y_1 +..., well,
we'll go all the way to y_(n-1)

189
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,720
+ y_n / 2.

190
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,450
If you check that
formula out here,

191
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,440
this is the trapezoidal rule.

192
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,220
If you check it out for
this case, then what you get

193
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,050
is that this is equal
to delta x times what?

194
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,629
Well, all of these are 1's.

195
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,170
And how many are
there in the middle?

196
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,440
There are n - 1 of
them in the middle.

197
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,740
So it's 1/2 + n - 1 + 1/2.

198
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,030
At the tail end.

199
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,680
So all told it's delta x n.

200
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,980
And I remind you that
delta x = b - a / n.

201
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,030
So, delta x, this thing,
is equal to b - a.

202
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,930
And that's just as it should be.

203
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,130
What we just calculated is an
approximation to this integral

204
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,080
here.

205
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,660
Which is just the area of
the rectangle of base b -

206
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,210
a and height 1.

207
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,080
Which of course is b - a.

208
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,540
So this is the check that
you got your weighted average

209
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,610
correct here.

210
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,880
You've put the correct
weightings on everything.

211
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,400
And you can do this same
thing with Simpson's Rule.

212
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:31,030
And match up those quantities.

213
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,390
There was a question in
the room at some point.

214
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,440
No, OK.

215
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,680
So now, the next thing
I want to do for you

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,730
is the loose end
which I left hanging.

217
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,280
Namely, I want to compute that
mysterious constant square root

218
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,680
of pi / 2.

219
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,260
This is really one of the
most famous computations

220
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,420
in calculus.

221
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,740
And it's a very,
very clever trick.

222
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,160
I certainly don't expect you
to come up with this trick.

223
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,360
I certainly wouldn't
have myself.

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,750
But it's an important
thing to calculate.

225
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,560
And it's just very useful.

226
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,310
So I'm going to
tell you about it.

227
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,400
And it's just on the subject
that we're dealing with

228
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,260
in this unit; namely, slicing.

229
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,400
Or adding up.

230
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,850
So the first step, which is just
something that we already did,

231
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:50,800
was that we found the
volume under this curve.

232
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,180
This bell-shaped
curve, e^(-r^2).

233
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,300
But rotated around an axis.

234
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:09,020
Rotated around this axis.

235
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,680
Around this way.

236
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,360
So we figured that out.

237
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,280
And that was a relatively
short computation.

238
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,870
I'm just going to remind
you, it goes by shells.

239
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,500
We integrate the whole
range from 0 to infinity.

240
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,530
And we have 2 pi r
2 pi r e^(-r^2) dr.

241
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,532
So this again is the
circumference of the shell.

242
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,240
This is the height of
the shell, and this

243
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,650
is the thickness of the shell.

244
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:45,280
Circumference,
height, thickness.

245
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,790
So we're just taking a little
piece here and sweeping it

246
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,520
around.

247
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,000
And then adding up.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,250
And then this antiderivative
is pi-- -pi e^(-r^2),

249
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,420
evaluated at 0 and infinity.

250
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,140
And we worked this
out last time.

251
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,520
This is pi.

252
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,700
It's pi (1 - 0).

253
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,200
Which is pi.

254
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,700
So the conclusion
is that V = pi.

255
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,220
We already know that.

256
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,770
Now, the problem that
we want to deal with now

257
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:31,460
is the problem not of
a volume, but an area.

258
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,990
And this looks quite different.

259
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,340
And of course the answer
is going to be different.

260
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,250
But let's do it.

261
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,610
So this is this
question mark here.

262
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:47,970
And I'm going to do the one
from minus infinity to infinity.

263
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,000
And I'll relate it
to what we talked

264
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,210
about earlier in this unit,
in just a couple of minutes

265
00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:00,520
when I show you the procedure
that we're going to follow.

266
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,710
So here's the
quantity and now, what

267
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,210
this is interpreted as is the
area under this bell curve.

268
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:22,950
This time, Q is really an area.

269
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,370
Now, what's going to turn
out to happen, is this.

270
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,920
This is the trick.

271
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,480
We're going to compute
V in a different way.

272
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,920
And you'll see it laid
out in just a second.

273
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,870
We will compute V by slices.

274
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,370
We're going to slice it
like a piece of bread here.

275
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,640
We're going to solve for
that same thing here.

276
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,120
And then, amazingly, what's
going to happen is that we will

277
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,720
discover that V = Q^2.

278
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,170
That's going to be
what's going to come out.

279
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,009
And that's the end of the
computation that we want.

280
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,800
Because actually we
already know what V is.

281
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,290
We don't want to read
this equation forward.

282
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,890
We want to read
it the other way.

283
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,310
We want to say Q^2 = V,
which we already know is pi.

284
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:29,770
And so Q is equal to
the square root of pi.

285
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,680
I haven't shown this yet,
this is the weird part.

286
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,560
And I'm going to put
it in a little box

287
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,220
so that we know that this
is what we need to check.

288
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,070
We need to check this fact here.

289
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,000
We haven't done that yet.

290
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Now, let me connect this with
what we did a few days ago.

291
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,690
With what I called one of
the important functions

292
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:02,540
of mathematics besides
the ones you already know.

293
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,810
And so the function
that we were faced with,

294
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:15,080
and that we discussed,
was this one.

295
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,380
And then, we were interested
in the value at infinity.

296
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,780
We were interested in this.

297
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,930
Which, if you draw
a picture of it,

298
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,650
and you draw the
same bell curve,

299
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,610
that's the area
under half. of it.

300
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,850
That's the area starting
from 0 and going to infinity.

301
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,470
That's the area under half.

302
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:46,270
So this chunk is F of infinity.

303
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,000
And now I hope that this
part of the connection

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,140
is not meant to be fancy.

305
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,760
The idea here is that
Q = 2 F(infinity).

306
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,190
This number here.

307
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,380
And so F F(infinity) is equal
to the square root of pi

308
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,900
over 2, if we believe what
we said on the last panel.

309
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,490
And that was the thing that I
drew a picture of on the board.

310
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,390
Namely, the graph of
F looked like this.

311
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,670
And there was this
asymptote, which

312
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,020
was the limit F(x) tends
to square root of pi

313
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,650
over 2, as x goes to infinity.

314
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,560
That was that limiting value.

315
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,910
Which is F of infinity.

316
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:40,460
So this is the asymptote.

317
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,350
And now I've explained
the connection

318
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,260
between what we claimed before,
which was quite mysterious,

319
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,840
and what we're actually going
to be able to check now.

320
00:20:50,840 --> 00:21:07,170
Concretely, by making
this computation.

321
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,980
So how in the world can you
get something like this.

322
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,490
What's in that orange
box there, that V = Q^2.

323
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,300
Again, the technique
is to use slices here.

324
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,860
And I'm going to have to
draw you a 3-D picture

325
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,970
to visualize the slice.

326
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,360
Let's do that.

327
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,520
I'm going to draw
three axes now,

328
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,640
because we're now going to be
in three-dimensional space,

329
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,250
and I want you to imagine
the x-axis as coming out

330
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,320
of the blackboard, the
y-axis is horizontal,

331
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,980
and there's a new
axis, which I'll call

332
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,090
the z-axis, which is going up.

333
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,860
So what's happening
here is that I'm

334
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,810
thinking of this-- This is,
if you like, some kind of side

335
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,320
view.

336
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,653
And this is a view where I've
tilted things a little bit

337
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:57,080
up to the top.

338
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,974
Now, the distribution,
or you could

339
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:01,640
think of this target
in the plane, where

340
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,110
the most likely places
to hit were in the middle

341
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,510
and it died off.

342
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,390
As we went down.

343
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,400
Now, I want to draw a
picture of this graph.

344
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,240
I'm going to draw a
picture of e^(-r^2).

345
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,090
And it's basically a hump.

346
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,420
So I'm going to take the
first-- the slice along y = 0.

347
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,880
The y = 0 slice.

348
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,300
And I claim that that
goes up like this.

349
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,310
And then comes back down.

350
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,100
Let me shade this in,
so that you can see

351
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,140
what kind of a slice this is.

352
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,679
This is supposed to be along
this vertical plane here.

353
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,220
Which is coming out
of the blackboard

354
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,409
and coming towards you.

355
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:43,200
And that's a slice.

356
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,630
Now, I'm going to draw
one more slice so that you

357
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,000
can see what's happening.

358
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,310
I'm going to draw a
slice at another place.

359
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,860
Along here.

360
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,030
This will be y = b.

361
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,709
Some other level.

362
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,500
And now I'm going to
show you what happens.

363
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,960
What happens is that the
hump dies down a little bit.

364
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,750
So the bump is just
a little bit lower.

365
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,284
And it's going to look a
little bit the same way.

366
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:11,950
But it's just going
to be a bit smaller.

367
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,380
So there's another slice here.

368
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,940
Like that.

369
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,890
And I want to give a
name to these slices.

370
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm going to call this A(b).

371
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:36,130
That is, the area
of the b slice.

372
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,790
Under the surface.

373
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,010
OK?

374
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,870
Yes, question.

375
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,256
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

376
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the solid.

377
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,890
Yeah.

378
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,830
We're trying to figure
out this volume here,

379
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,780
which is the one we started
out with, by slices.

380
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,500
So first I have to think
of-- I'm going to visualize--

381
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,970
So here I didn't even visualize.

382
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,490
I took a cross
section and I thought

383
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,580
about how to spin it around
without actually doing that

384
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,954
in three-dimensional space.

385
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:10,120
But now I'm going to take
a different kind of slice.

386
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,260
I'm going to take
that same bump, which

387
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,680
is a three-dimensional object.

388
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,050
I'm going to lay
it down on a plane.

389
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,540
Which looks like this.

390
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,850
And then it's a bump here.

391
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,260
It's a hump.

392
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,350
And now I'm going to try to
slice it by various planes.

393
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

394
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:34,270
PROFESSOR: So one
way of defining

395
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,609
the bump, as you just suggested,
is you take this curve

396
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,150
and you rotate it
around this z-axis.

397
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,400
So in other words, you make
this the axis of rotation,

398
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,505
you spin it around.

399
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:44,130
That's correct.

400
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,020
So that shows you that the
peaks as you go down here

401
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,740
are going to descend
the same way.

402
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,140
But I don't want to
draw those lines.

403
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,780
I want to imagine what
the parallel slices are.

404
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,610
Because I don't want
to get cross slices.

405
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,950
I want all slices parallel
to the same thing.

406
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,997
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

407
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:05,580
PROFESSOR: OK.

408
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:13,070
This is not particularly
easy to visualize.

409
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,960
Now, here's the formula
for volume by slices.

410
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,900
The formula for volume by
slices is that you add up

411
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,770
the areas of the slices.

412
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,050
That's how you do it.

413
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,465
You take each slice.

414
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:33,840
You add the
cross-sectional area,

415
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,170
and then you take a
little thickness, dy,

416
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,330
and then you add all of them up.

417
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,950
Because this is extending
over the whole plane,

418
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,630
we're going to have to go all
the way from minus infinity

419
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,100
to plus infinity.

420
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:56,940
And this is the formula
for volumes by slicing.

421
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,300
And now our goal, in order
to do this calculation,

422
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,620
we're going to just fix
y is equal to some b.

423
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,840
We're just going to fix
one of these slices.

424
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,454
And we're going
to calculate A(b).

425
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:14,870
That's what we
need to do in order

426
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:23,030
to make this procedure succeed.

427
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,740
This is the only place
where this method works.

428
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,120
But it's an important one.

429
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,195
In order to make
it work, I'm going

430
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:37,760
to have to again draw the plot
from a different point of view.

431
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,550
I'm going to do the top view.

432
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:48,750
So I want to look down
on this x-y plane here.

433
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,020
This is the x-direction,
and here's the y-direction.

434
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,930
And then again I want
to draw my slice.

435
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,760
My slice is here.

436
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,860
At y = b.

437
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,430
So we're just
right on top of it.

438
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,404
And it's coming up
at some kind of bump.

439
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:11,070
Here, with a little
higher in the middle

440
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,970
and going down on the sides.

441
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,210
Now, the formula for
the height is this.

442
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,290
If I take a distance r here,
the formula for the height

443
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,290
of the bump is e^(-r^2).

444
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,390
I'll store that over here.

445
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,910
e^(-r^2) is the
height at this place.

446
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,020
If this distance
to the origin is r.

447
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,360
That's true all the way around.

448
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,622
And in terms of b and x,
we can figure out that

449
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:49,580
by this right triangle.

450
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,400
This height is b, and
this distance is x.

451
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,940
So r^2 = b^2 + x^2.

452
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,560
Question.

453
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:15,350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

454
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,105
PROFESSOR: The question
is, is that the x-y plane.

455
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:23,280
So the answer is that over here
I cleverly used the letter r.

456
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,010
I avoided using y's
and z's or anything.

457
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,970
And over here, this
is the distance r.

458
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,650
And you like, this
is z, going up.

459
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,430
That's the way to think of it.

460
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,180
So that all of the
letters are consistent.

461
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,170
So I just avoided
giving it a name.

462
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,960
That's good, that's
exactly the point.

463
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
Alright.

464
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,870
So now, I claim I have
a formula for r^2.

465
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,397
And so I can write this down.

466
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:49,230
This e^(-b^2 + x^2).

467
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,934
But now I'm going to use
the rule of exponents.

468
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:04,350
Which is that this is the same
as e^(-b^2) times e^(-x^2).

469
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,330
And that's going to be
the main way in which we

470
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,590
use the particular function
that we're dealing with here.

471
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,940
That's really the
main step, amazingly.

472
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:33,470
So now I get to
compute what A(b) is.

473
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,960
A(b) is the area under a curve.

474
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,300
So it's going to be, let
me write it over here,

475
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:47,160
A(b) is the area
under this curve here.

476
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,580
Which is some constant
times-- so if you imagine,

477
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,270
call this thing the name c.

478
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,070
Under some curve, ce^(-x^2).

479
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,040
Where the c is
equal to e^(-b^2).

480
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,560
That's what our slice is.

481
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,060
In fact, it looks
like one of those.

482
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,970
It looks like one
of those bumps.

483
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,630
Here's its formula again.

484
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,850
It's the integral from
minus infinity to infinity

485
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,500
of e^(-b^2) e^(-x^2) dx.

486
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,560
We just recopied
what I had up there.

487
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:37,430
And this is the height at
each value of x, with b fixed.

488
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:42,630
And now, so we have
a lot of steps here.

489
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,680
But each of them
is very elementary.

490
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,380
The first one was just
that law of exponents.

491
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,520
That we could split
the two into products.

492
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,970
Now I'm going to make that
splitting even further.

493
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,420
This is a constant.

494
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,150
It's not varying with x.

495
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,060
So I'm going to factor
it out of the integral.

496
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,230
This is e^(-b^2) times the
integral from minus infinity

497
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,850
to infinity of e^(-x^2) dx.

498
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,890
So this might look frightening,
but actually it's just

499
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,110
the property of an integral.

500
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,180
All integrals have
this kind of property.

501
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,090
You can always factor
out a constant.

502
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,900
And now here comes
the remarkable thing.

503
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,920
This is e^(-b^2) times a number
which is now familiar to us.

504
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,980
What is this number?

505
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,280
This is what we're looking for.

506
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:40,550
This is our unknown, Q.
So I've computed A(b),

507
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:44,260
and now I'm ready to
finish the problem off.

508
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,720
A(b) = e^(-b^2) Q. Q is
that strange number which we

509
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,380
don't know yet.

510
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,850
What it is.

511
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,570
So now I'm going to
compute the whole volume.

512
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,850
The whole volume,
remember, it's over there,

513
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,540
it's minus infinity
to infinity, A(y) dy.

514
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,300
And now I'm just going to plug
in the formula that we've found

515
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,860
for A. Now I'm doing
this for each b,

516
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,740
so I'm doing it
varying over all b's.

517
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,710
So I have the integral from
minus infinity to infinity.

518
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,490
And here I have e^(-y^2).

519
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,620
I've replaced b by y.

520
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,640
And now I have Q. And I have dy.

521
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,970
I just recopied what
I had over there

522
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,100
into the formula for slicing.

523
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,920
And now, I'm going to do
this trick of factoring out

524
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,260
the constant a second time.

525
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,860
This is a constant.

526
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,180
It doesn't depend on y.

527
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,030
It's the same for all y,
it just will factor out.

528
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,880
So this is the same as Q
times the integral from minus

529
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,350
infinity to infinity,
e^(-y^2) dy.

530
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,200
And now, lo and behold,
this expression here.

531
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,510
Of course, notice how
I defined Q. Let's

532
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,950
go back carefully to
where Q is defined.

533
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,900
Here's Q. This t is
a dummy variable.

534
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,370
It doesn't matter
what I call it.

535
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,790
I can call it x,
I can call it u,

536
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,620
I can call it v.
In this case, I've

537
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,020
given it two different names.

538
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,030
At this stage, I called it x.

539
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,860
And at this stage
I'm calling it y.

540
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,970
But it's the same variable.

541
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,650
And so this little chunk is
Q and altogether I have two

542
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,320
of them, for Q^2
being the total.

543
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:32,050
And that's the end
of the argument.

544
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,010
It's a real miracle.

545
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:45,920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

546
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,580
PROFESSOR: Great question.

547
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,490
The question is, wait a minute.

548
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:53,620
As y changes, doesn't x change.

549
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,120
And so then this
wouldn't be a constant.

550
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,740
So that's the way in which
we've used the letters x and y

551
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,110
in this whole course.

552
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,710
When you get to 18.02,
you'll almost never do that.

553
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,807
Always y and x will be
different variables.

554
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,640
And they won't have to
depend on each other.

555
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,700
Now, let me show you where on
this picture the x and the y

556
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,610
are.

557
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,000
We've got a whole x-y plane,
and here I'm fixing y = b,

558
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,220
y isn't varying.

559
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,340
Whereas x is changing.

560
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,000
So, in other words, I don't have
a relationship between x and y,

561
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,900
unless I fix it.

562
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,690
In this case I've decided that
y is going to be constant.

563
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,400
For all x.

564
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,110
Over here, I made a computation.

565
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,380
And I have a Q, which
is just a single number.

566
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,830
No matter which b I took,
it didn't matter which.

567
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,130
No matter which y equals b.

568
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,930
Of course, I changed
the name to b so it

569
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,630
wouldn't be so jarring to you.

570
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,920
But in fact this
b was y all along.

571
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,460
It's just that the x varied
completely independently

572
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:57,960
of the y.

573
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,300
I could fix the y and vary
the x, I could fix the x

574
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,390
and vary the y.

575
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,590
So it's a different
use of the letters.

576
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,720
From what you're used to.

577
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,360
It happens that y is
not a function of x.

578
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,171
In this case.

579
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:11,670
Yes.

580
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,455
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

581
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:17,080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

582
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

583
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,610
PROFESSOR: The question
is, because I'm

584
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,000
rotating around the z-axis,
doesn't x change exactly

585
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,210
as much as y does.

586
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,790
What happens is that x and
y are symmetric variables.

587
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,870
They can be treated equally.

588
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,660
But if I decide to take slices
with respect to y being fixed

589
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,070
and x varying, then of
course they're now separated,

590
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,410
and I have a separate role
for the x and a separate role

591
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,870
for the y.

592
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,420
Or if I'd sliced
it the other way,

593
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,920
I would have gotten
the same answer.

594
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,560
I just would have reversed
the roles of x and y.

595
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,100
So what's happening
is that x and y

596
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,150
are on equal footing with
each other in this picture,

597
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,650
and I could've
sliced the other way.

598
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,610
I would have gotten
the same answer.

599
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,660
That's more or less the
answer to your question.

600
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,180
OK.

601
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,300
Now I have given
you a review sheet,

602
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,150
and I want to run
through, briefly,

603
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,390
what's going to be on the exam.

604
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,140
And this list of
exam questions is

605
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,120
what's going to be on the exam.

606
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,390
There are, sorry this is
not displayed correctly.

607
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,110
So, exam questions,
but now I'm just

608
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,490
going to show you what they are.

609
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,090
There are five
questions on the exam.

610
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:46,580
They are completely parallel
to what you got last year.

611
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,100
So you should look at that test.

612
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,570
It's worth looking at.

613
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,750
And you'll see in the
descriptions on this sheet

614
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:00,410
that what I'm describing
is what's on that test.

615
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,160
So what's going to happen
is - and this is also

616
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,790
posted on the Web
- is that you'll

617
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,020
be expected to calculate
some definite integrals using

618
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,750
the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

619
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,000
Do a numerical approximation.

620
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,930
There'll be a Riemann,
a trapezoidal rule

621
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,550
and a Simpson's Rule.

622
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,770
Calculate areas and volumes.

623
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,510
And then some other
cumulative sum.

624
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,990
Either an average value or
probability or perhaps work.

625
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,410
And sketch a function
which is given

626
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:37,380
in this form as an integral.

627
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,020
So those are the
questions, and you'll

628
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,080
see by the example of last
year's exam exactly the style.

629
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,540
They're really going
to be very similar.

630
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,450
Yes, question.

631
00:37:49,450 --> 00:38:01,582
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

632
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:02,790
PROFESSOR: OK, good question.

633
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,560
So the question is,
for Riemann sums,

634
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,850
what's the difference
between upper and lower,

635
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:19,750
and right and left?

636
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:25,300
So here we have a Riemann sum.

637
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,720
And I'm going to give
you a picture which is,

638
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,045
maybe this function y = 1 /
x, which was the one that we

639
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:37,900
were discussing earlier.

640
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,420
If you take the
function y = 1 / x

641
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,540
and you break it up
into pieces here,

642
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,370
however it doesn't
matter how many pieces,

643
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,390
let's just say there
are four of them.

644
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,020
Then the lower Riemann
sum is the staircase

645
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,490
which fits underneath.

646
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:01,270
So this one is a picture
of the lower sum.

647
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,220
It's always less.

648
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,960
And in the case of a decreasing
function, it's going to be,

649
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:19,530
so since if you like,
since 1 / x decreases,

650
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:27,710
the lower sum equals
the right sum.

651
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,980
You can see that
visually on this picture.

652
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,730
The values you're
going to select

653
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,360
are going to be the right
ends of the rectangles.

654
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,980
The upper sum is the left one.

655
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,340
Now, if the function
wiggles up and down,

656
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,700
then you have to pick
whichever side is appropriate.

657
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,366
Or maybe it'll be a
point in the middle,

658
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:54,360
if the maximum is
achieved in the middle.

659
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,370
Yeah, another question.

660
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:02,549
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

661
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:03,340
PROFESSOR: Correct.

662
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:09,630
If the function is
increasing, then the lower sum

663
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,170
is the left sum.

664
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,630
So it just exactly
reverses what's here.

665
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,920
So this is decreasing,
lower sum is right-hand sum.

666
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,400
Increasing, lower
sum is left-hand sum.

667
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,135
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

668
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:26,760
PROFESSOR: Yes.

669
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:44,549
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

670
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:45,590
PROFESSOR: Good question.

671
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,570
Suppose you're faced
with a function like this

672
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,660
in this last problem.

673
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,270
Which, generally, these
are the trickiest problems.

674
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,150
And the question is,
how are you ever going

675
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,790
to be able to decide
on an asymptote,

676
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,110
even whether there
is an asymptote.

677
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,930
And the answer is, you're not.

678
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,211
It's going to be
pretty tricky to get

679
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:07,460
keep track of what's happening
as it goes to infinity.

680
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,960
We had an example
on the homework

681
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,470
where is was
oscillating and it's

682
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,100
very unclear what's going on.

683
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,100
You have to do a very
long analysis for that.

684
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,892
So in fact, just don't
worry about that now.

685
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,350
At the very end of
the class, we'll

686
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,180
talk a little bit
about these asymptotes.

687
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,620
And really, the first issue
is whether they exist or not.

688
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,275
And that's even something.

689
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:32,150
That's a serious question
which we'll address

690
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,800
at the very end of this course.

691
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

692
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
PROFESSOR: That's right.

693
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,840
It's not going to be
anything that complicated.

694
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,350
Other questions?

695
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,100
We we still have a
five whole minutes,

696
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,440
and I have an example to give,
if nobody has a question.

697
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,940
Yeah.

698
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,773
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

699
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:55,710
PROFESSOR: The question,
uh, will I tell you

700
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,410
which one of what to use?

701
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,910
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR: When

702
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,576
I tell you the numeric
approximation is,

703
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:04,450
you'll see on the exam.

704
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,450
The practice exam that you have.

705
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,220
I will ask you for all three.

706
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,620
I will ask you for the Riemann
sum, the trapezoidal rule,

707
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,660
and the Simpson's rule.

708
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,104
I'm guaranteeing you they'll
all three be on the exam.

709
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:18,020
I'm guaranteeing that
every single thing which

710
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,930
is on that piece of
paper is on the exam.

711
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,865
And you'll see it on the
exam that you've got.

712
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:27,420
It's exactly parallel
to what's there.

713
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,341
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

714
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,840
PROFESSOR: So with
areas and volume,

715
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,720
the question is will I tell
you which method to use.

716
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:48,340
So let's discuss that.

717
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:58,180
So with areas and volumes,
there's basically--

718
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,170
So this is always
true with areas.

719
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:07,040
And it's true with
volumes of revolution.

720
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,970
By the way you should
read this sheet.

721
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,740
Not everything that's
on here have I said.

722
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,020
But you should read it.

723
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,470
Because it's all relevant.

724
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,820
So with volumes of revolution,
you always work your way

725
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:25,600
back to some 2-D diagram.

726
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,910
So there's some 2-D
diagram which is always--

727
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,090
two-dimensional
diagram, which is always

728
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,960
connected with these problems.

729
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,960
I mean, something this hard
is really just too hard

730
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,080
to do on an exam, right?

731
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,538
I mean, I'm not going to ask
you something this complicated

732
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:42,472
on the exam.

733
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:44,180
Because this involves
a three-dimensional

734
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,200
visualization.

735
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,270
But once you're
down to 2-D, you're

736
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,180
supposed to be
able to handle it.

737
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,710
Now, what's the main issue after
you've got your 2-D diagram?

738
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,990
The main issue is, do you
want to integrate with respect

739
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:06,950
to dx or dy?

740
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,850
And the answer is
that it will depend.

741
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,810
And if there's one
that's going to cause

742
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:21,310
you incredible difficulty,
and I feel that you're not

743
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,940
able to dodge it, then
I might give you a hint

744
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,750
and say you'd better use
shells, or you'd better

745
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,370
use disks or washers
or something like that.

746
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,760
But if I feel that you're
grown up enough to figure out

747
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,470
which one it is, because
one of them is so ridiculous

748
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,840
you say forget it, immediately,
after thinking about it.

749
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,460
Then I won't tell you which one.

750
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,870
Because I figure,
in other words,

751
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,160
I don't want you
to waste your time.

752
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,580
But I'm willing to waste a
minute or two of your time

753
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:57,420
on a wild goose chase.

754
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,380
So let me give you
an example of this.

755
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:14,670
Suppose you're looking at the
curve y between 0 and x - x^3.

756
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,380
So this is some kind of lump.

757
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,460
Like this.

758
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:25,080
It goes from 0 to 1, because the
right-hand side is 0 at 0 and 1

759
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,921
here.

760
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:26,920
It's some kind of thing.

761
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,850
And there are these
two possibilities.

762
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,220
One of them is to do shells.

763
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:41,040
And then, so this is supposed
to be rotated around the y-axis.

764
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,940
In this case.

765
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,519
And the same would apply,
actually, to the area problem.

766
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,560
So I'm doing a slightly
more complicated problem.

767
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,660
But you could ask for the area
underneath this, and so forth.

768
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,480
OK.

769
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,400
So we can integrate this dx,
or we can integrate this dy.

770
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,130
This indicates that
I'm deciding that this

771
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,600
is going to be of thickness
dx, and I'm integrating dx.

772
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,940
So that's a choice
that I'm making.

773
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,160
Now, the minute I
made that choice

774
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,000
I know that these are shells.

775
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,980
Because they sweep around this
way and that makes them shells.

776
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,460
Cylindrical shells.

777
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,210
And if I do that,
the setup is this.

778
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:25,540
It's 2 2 pi x (x - x^3) dx.

779
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,340
Now, I claim that when
you get to this point,

780
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,580
you already know you've won.

781
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,920
Because this is an easy
integral to calculate.

782
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,640
So you're done here.

783
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,840
You're happy.

784
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,930
Now, if you happened to say,
oh gee, I hate to do this.

785
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,040
I want to do
something clever, you

786
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:54,220
could try to do it
with cutting this way.

787
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,500
Let's do this.

788
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,610
And this would be
the dy thickness.

789
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,760
And then when you
sweep this around,

790
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,560
you get what we call a washer.

791
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,710
Which is really just the
difference of two disks.

792
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:24,560
So the shape here is this
thing swung around this axis.

793
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,110
And it looks like this.

794
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,270
So it's going to be the
difference of radii.

795
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,580
So what's the formula for this?

796
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:37,070
It's some integral of
pi times the right end,

797
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,550
which I'll call x_2,
and here the left end,

798
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,720
which I'll call x_1.

799
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,860
So this is pi pi
(x_2^2 - x_1^2) dy.

800
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,510
Now, already at this stage,
you think to yourself

801
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:54,740
this is more complicated
than the other method.

802
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,500
So you've already abandoned it.

803
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,790
But I'm just going to go one
step further into this one

804
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,860
to see what it is
that's happening.

805
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:08,950
If you try to figure out what
these values x_1 and x_2 are,

806
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:14,740
that corresponds to solving
for x_1 and x_2 in terms of y.

807
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,200
So that's the
following equation.

808
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:25,590
x_1 and x_2 solve the
equation that-- the curve, x -

809
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:32,080
x^3 is equal y.

810
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,790
Now, look at this equation.

811
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:42,290
That's the equation x^3--
sorry, x^3 - x + y, I guess.

812
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,320
Let's see.

813
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,880
Yeah, that's right,
is equal to 0.

814
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,370
This is a cubic equation.

815
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,060
Although there is
a formula for this.

816
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,351
You've never been taught the
formula for this equation.

817
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,920
So therefore, you
will never, ever

818
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,560
be able to get a formula for
x_2 and x_1 as a function of y.

819
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,030
And you'll never be able
to compute this one.

820
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:08,030
This is more than just a dead
end, it's like crash, burn,

821
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,300
and, you know, self-destruct.

822
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,670
So there may be such a
thing, so do the other way.

823
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,490
Good luck, folks.
